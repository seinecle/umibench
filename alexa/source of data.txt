Data is extracted from the file human_annotations/factual_dataset_expert.csv

at this repo: https://github.com/alexa/factual-consistency-analysis-of-dialogs/

This is a project by the Alexa research team on how to distinguish facts from opinions.

In the file factual_dataset_expert.csv; the field "knowledge" contains factual statements derived from the field "context"

Entries in this field are objective, not subjective.

In practice, I extracted all the entries of the "knowledge" field, with filters on two other fields:
- "hallucination" = No
- "verifiable" = y (yes)

This led to 470 entries, all labelled as "Objective"
