# Umibench: testbench for 📏 factuality and 🎭 sentiment classifiers

## Function
Umibench compares the performance of various models on 2 tasks: detection of factuality (objectivity vs subjectivity) and detection of sentiment (positive, negative or neutral).

It generates a leaderboard which is visible at the bottom of this page.

## How to add a model or a dataset to this leaderboard? Just provide a link!

I will take care of everything. Please send:

- for a labelled dataset: a link to a place where I can download it.
- for a model: a url to the API of the model. If an API key is necessary, please provide it. Otherwise I will do my best to run it at my own expense.

## Which models are tested so far?
