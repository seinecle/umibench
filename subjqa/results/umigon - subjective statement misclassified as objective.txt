I think this is the smallest size possible for a usb flash drive. I bought this to store music and leave it plugged into my car's usb port. It is a little hard to remove once plugged in but I think it is a good thing. It has a small hole at the top for a string to be attached for easier removal. The tranfer rate is similar to an average usb drive and the price is very reasonable. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I owned a 1st generation Sansa and was very pleased with it.  It cost around $25.00 and lasted almost 3 years.  So when it quit working (rechargeable batteries are not replaceable by consumer), I was unconcerned that the price was then almost double.  Well, here is is just a bit over a year since purchase (less than 60 days), and it will no longer charge.  What really chaps my a--, is I went and looked up the warranty.  In the United States, the warranty is for 1 year.  If I was in Europe, the warranty is for 2 years.  So tell me Sansa, how do Europeans use the device differently to warrant a double warranty period?

Installed on system running Windows 7 x64 Ultimate.  Had ZoneAlarm Security Suite installed and the installation software would install but the unit would not see my router.  Contacted TP-LINK and after talking to one of their phone support tech, had gotten an RMA assuming the unit was defective.Not really wanting to ship the unit back to TP-LINK for a replacement, I did a bit of internet research and discovered that this unit has issues with ZoneAlarm Security Suite.  The write-up recommended uninstalling ZoneAlarm, installing the driver, then reinstalling ZoneAlarm.  I uninstalled ZoneAlarm and it took Windows 7 out with it.After reinstalling Windows 7, the TL-WN822N came up with signal strength 5 and is now working fine. ANSWERNOTFOUND

product had been opened and programed.  Password had been changed and there were finger prints all over it.  What I ordered was supposed to have been new and this had obviously been opened and used by someone but all the parts were there.  A novice would have ended up returning this item in the condition it arrived.  Had to reset it so that the default password would work and I could get into it, after that it worked fine.  Interface is not user friendly to set up.  It is all there just not friendly.  I have worked with a lot of routers and this one seemed to have a confusing interface.  The help files were helpful.  There are easier routers out there.  This one has really good range. Set up is kind of awkward.  I bought it for the range and it is a good router just the interface is not intuitive. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I decided to buy these despite the negative reviews, and I'm glad I did. They may not be the cadillac of in-ear earbuds, but they are well worth the $6 total cost.

This ASUS router is a very attractive piece of electronic hardware, with its black diamond embossed plastic case.  It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).  Nevertheless, even with that omission, this is a great deal for the power, performance and range I get with this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND

great for the money and might order again if i needed a quick pair of headphones but even after little time using them my ears get sore. i've had earbud headphones before these are just like many of them , almost all hurt eventually at some point these are better than round plastic knockoffs and work great and sound good, at least has some good base. very cheap price so worth the money they are okay.

I bought this card to use in my Blackberry Bold 9000.  I figured since the item description shows that it comes preformatted at FAT32 that I would be good to go.  Much to my surprise I was not....I figured the card was bad....and thus the research began.The solution was quite simple.....simiply re-format the card to fat-32 again and you should be able to use it in all compatible devices.  Very Very strange....but it worked in the Blackberry this time around.I have always liked kingston products and their memory cards....so I am giving this a 4/5 due to the tiny little formatting issue.

I think plenty has been said about the technical pros and cons about this monitor, and I bought because (and despite) of those reviews, but an unexpected benefit of having this monitor was to be able to quickly see how a website behaves under a narrow and long viewport e.g. a smartphone screen.  Because the resolution of this isn't so great, it actually mimics a phone's dimensions a good bit when this is pivoted on its side.  Keep your Firebug-style inspector at the bottom and it becomes a great debugger for CSS when trying to see how different settings will behave on a phone. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought this specifically because it would allow me to stream my home media. I spent over six hours trying to make this happen (my LG blu-ray from 3 years ago took 10 minutes to set up) before I said to myself &#34;wait a minute, why are you investing so much time and energy on this?&#34;. After researching the web, what I found is you need to use media server software on your pc (not just a Windows share) to make this work (I guess).So, I returned it and bought a Roku 3 - couldn't be happier. I may not be able to stream, but the enhanced channel selection (including Amazon, which WD DOESN'T support) was worth it. Now I just copy what I want from my pc to a memory stick (in far less than the six+ hour &#34;song and dance&#34; that the WD took).Western Digital has a long way to go in understanding it's customer base when it comes to tools like this (in my opinion - your mileage may vary).

By now if your looking on this page you're at least thinking you want the Kindle Fire HD. The main question you should ask yourself is do you shop or buy from amazon. If the answer is yes, buy it. If you don't, then buy something else. It's pretty much as easy as that. I don't understand all these people that buy the Fire HD to "try it out" and complain that it takes the Fire 4.5888888 seconds longer to load a screen than the nexus or ipad. Can you really not wait a total of 5 extra seconds for a device to load a page? I think if that is a deal breaker for you, perhaps you have bigger problems at hand. There is really nothing that I found that I can complain about with this tablet, I'm owned several kindles over the years and I loved the 1st fire which i recently sold once I ordered this one. Many people have already stated the improvements and I agree 100% with what other reviewers have said. This is my first Kindle also with the "Ads" on the device and I must say, it's not nearly as annoying as I had thought it was going to be. I also like the whole "customers have also bought" section on the home screen as it gives you other items that you may like. My book wish list is quickly filling up thanks to that tricky little feature. As others have said, the screen is amazing. Watching a film in HD, hell I think the picture is better than my 3 year old Toshiba HDTV. The built in speakers do sound better than any other speakers on any device I have heard, however I still mostly use headphones while watching movies or videos on it. Again, its a great device, there is nothing I can complain about here. The fact that for under $300 I have a HD tablet with case and charger is pretty much amazing. Listen to the people that actually like the Fire HD and shop with amazon. Ignore all these fanboys that just make a review to give it a 1-star rating. ANSWERNOTFOUND

It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time. The zoom, compactness, and fantastic video implementation are wonderful. Just don't pixel-peep at 100% or you'll be disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought it at Sam's.  Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers.  As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC.  The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work.  The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet.  That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room.  That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to.  I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems.  However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000.  The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys.  The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000.  One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range).  However if you need a new keyboard on have an old mouse that's finicky of some surfaces, this keyboard may well suit your needs.Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 ANSWERNOTFOUND

This one is cheap, I thought it would be good to have. I've been bothered the most by the fact that it needs to be plugged into a USB port in order for it to work (or to a power outlet, meaning either an extra cord or less a USB port). The the thing is not that small to sit nicely plugged directly into the HDMI port.I was able to pair it, but I didn't see that much value in it. It feels like an experiment and it doesn't feel like an honestly advertised product.Granted I have different ways to enjoy my media already, so maybe I'm also spoiled.

While this lens will allow you to shoot in very low light, the resulting images will be very soft.

If Canon were to ever be nervous about the competition in point and shoot camera's, they are likely crapping themselves at this moment.  I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice ANSWERNOTFOUND

I have been using Asus monitors for a few years now.  I think they make a fine monitor.  I had a horrible 27&#34; Haans-G monitor that died in a little over 18 months.  It started flickering and dying long before then.  When that died, I decided to look into a smaller, more reliable monitor so I didn't care as much when it dies.This is my second Asus and I use them in a dual head setup.  The HDMI inputs are connected to an HDMI switch and some of the DVI or VGA ports are directly tied into other computers.  The contrast and color is bright on this monitor.

[Edit 10/27/2013]After I began to edit the review, I thought it would be best to reopen the packed box and retest the tablet.  To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates "templates," the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]"Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store. New Hulu Plus users get a 3-month trial and new Boingo users get mobile Wi-Fi access for 12 months. Also, new Audible users get 3 free audiobooks and new Zinio members get a 2-month subscription to 3 digital magazines. New BusinessWeek+ Tablet App users can also enjoy a 1-year free subscription, and new NYTimes.com + Tablet App users get a 12-week free subscription. All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app."These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the "pleather" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol ANSWERNOTFOUND

While this lens will allow you to shoot in very low light, the resulting images will be very soft.  It sharpens up nicely by f/4, but there are several zoom lenses (e.g. 24-105mm f/4L) that can match it at that aperture.  While quick, the auto focus is not very accurate.  I spent a lot of time dialing in the AF micro-adjustment on my camera (7D), and while I was able to improve the average case, the variance was just too large to yield an acceptable "keeper" rate.

I go through a lot of earbuds trying to find ones that have awesome sound.  So far, I have not heard anything better than those made by JVC!  I started with the Marshmallows and could not believe the sound they delivered for the price (now less than $10).  Not only that, but the fit made them just as good or better than other 'noise-cancelling' models I've tried.  I travel A LOT so I need something that will deliver strong, crisp, deep sound even when I'm sitting in a noisy airport or loud airplane.  These little guys deliver!  I saw them in the store for less than $20 so I just couldn't pass them up...especially with a name like Xtreme Xplosives.  They even come with a hard case for storage and different sizes of adapters to fit all ears.  At first glance, they seem pretty big for earbuds, but when you put them in your ear you hardly even notice the size...until you turn on your music - that's when you'll be blown away!  It seriously feels like there are 10" subwoofers sitting inside your ears!  These seal up really well also so I can't hear anything that's going on around me whenever the music is on; it's awesome!  Not only does the bass pound, but the mids and highs are also crisp/clear at all volume levels.  I've tried all of those high end brands (Klipsch, Bose, Beats, Koss, etc) and these are just as good or better at a fraction of the price!  My biggest disappointment was when I decided to try the Beats that everyone is walking around with these days.  After listening to them compared to these, there is absolutely no way I'd pay close to $200 for a pair of earbuds whose performance doesn't come close to these that are less than $30.  Don't waste your money on the high ends...buy these Xtreme earbuds (or any other JVCs for that matter) and you won't be disappointed! ANSWERNOTFOUND

By now if your looking on this page you're at least thinking you want the Kindle Fire HD. The main question you should ask yourself is do you shop or buy from amazon. If the answer is yes, buy it. If you don't, then buy something else. It's pretty much as easy as that. I don't understand all these people that buy the Fire HD to "try it out" and complain that it takes the Fire 4.5888888 seconds longer to load a screen than the nexus or ipad. Can you really not wait a total of 5 extra seconds for a device to load a page? I think if that is a deal breaker for you, perhaps you have bigger problems at hand. There is really nothing that I found that I can complain about with this tablet, I'm owned several kindles over the years and I loved the 1st fire which i recently sold once I ordered this one. Many people have already stated the improvements and I agree 100% with what other reviewers have said. This is my first Kindle also with the "Ads" on the device and I must say, it's not nearly as annoying as I had thought it was going to be. I also like the whole "customers have also bought" section on the home screen as it gives you other items that you may like. My book wish list is quickly filling up thanks to that tricky little feature. As others have said, the screen is amazing. Watching a film in HD, hell I think the picture is better than my 3 year old Toshiba HDTV. The built in speakers do sound better than any other speakers on any device I have heard, however I still mostly use headphones while watching movies or videos on it. Again, its a great device, there is nothing I can complain about here. The fact that for under $300 I have a HD tablet with case and charger is pretty much amazing. Listen to the people that actually like the Fire HD and shop with amazon. Ignore all these fanboys that just make a review to give it a 1-star rating. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I purchased a 16 and 32 gig of this flash drive.  I tried to transfer my files from my old 16 gig to the new 32 gig.  Transferred a few files then locked up.  Windows could not locate the drive.  Unplug, replug, Windows (7 64bit) finds it and I start copying again.  The same thing happens.  Tried this a couple more times.  The slow transfer time would have been tolerable if it would just complete the file transfer.  While copying it would say approx. 50 minutes to transfer 10 gigs.  It would run maybe 3 minutes and stop.  Small files would transfer succesfully.  Transferring a movie was out of the question.  I thought maybe this one was defective so I installed the 16 gig version.  I had the same problem.  So neither one are of any use to me. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought this camera based on some of the reviews and because I didn't want to shell out $1000 for an DSLR. I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not  spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the "flavor of the month". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR . Not by a long shot. ANSWERNOTFOUND

One tiny nit - the Amazon description is incorrect - this is a 10.2-Inch case, not 10 inch. But wait, it turns out that the extra 0.2 inch means that this case will hold both the iPad in a padded leather-like case from MoKo AND the Apple wireless keyboard in the same compartment.

This one is cheap, I thought it would be good to have. I've been bothered the most by the fact that it needs to be plugged into a USB port in order for it to work (or to a power outlet, meaning either an extra cord or less a USB port). The the thing is not that small to sit nicely plugged directly into the HDMI port.I was able to pair it, but I didn't see that much value in it. It feels like an experiment and it doesn't feel like an honestly advertised product.Granted I have different ways to enjoy my media already, so maybe I'm also spoiled. I own Apple products and I have an Apple TV, also the TV is a smart TV with USB ports and media sharing and I also use a PS3 for different media. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought this specifically because it would allow me to stream my home media. I spent over six hours trying to make this happen (my LG blu-ray from 3 years ago took 10 minutes to set up) before I said to myself &#34;wait a minute, why are you investing so much time and energy on this?&#34;. After researching the web, what I found is you need to use media server software on your pc (not just a Windows share) to make this work (I guess).So, I returned it and bought a Roku 3 - couldn't be happier. I may not be able to stream, but the enhanced channel selection (including Amazon, which WD DOESN'T support) was worth it. Now I just copy what I want from my pc to a memory stick (in far less than the six+ hour &#34;song and dance&#34; that the WD took).Western Digital has a long way to go in understanding it's customer base when it comes to tools like this (in my opinion - your mileage may vary).

As others have mentioned the lens is quite solid but the hood is cheap feeling.  I got this for my D5100 to try to get some decent indoor volleyball pictures.  I wanted a fast lens with a little magnification for for action at about 10-30 meters range.  This lens does just what I wanted.  The magnification factor for an APS-c sensor  about right. If there are any distortions in the corners I won't notice them on my camera.  I don't think this lens is recommended for a full frame camera.The manual focus is smooth and doesn't pull.  I am still not sure this is the best lens for what I want since the DOF is only about a foot or two at 30 feet and f1.4.  That is just physics and nothing wrong with the lens itselfI plan on doing some portrait work with it in the near future and expect good things. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I've owned several brands of IEMs that I use mostly for the gym and listening to music at work without disturbing coworkers.Most IEMs last at least a year or two and then the damage from pulling, sweat, wear and tear etc kill them, which is to be expected. So I purchased these hoping that they would be more durable because of the construction and item description.I was wrong.It's only been 4 months and the bottom part of the cable already causes issues and will only work when held tightly, as headphones will do after years of use, not 4 months.The sound quality is just alright on these. I am a music producer so I know good from bad, and these are as meh as you can get. Not great bass, mids are decent, highs are good. However these stay in my ears worse than almost any IEMs I've ever tried, regardless which ear pieces I use. ANSWERNOTFOUND

One may look at me strangely, friends may call it "dorky", others may mistake it for a hearing device, but now it is purely a part of me. Day 2 of purchasing this, I've already stopped feeling its weight on my neck. I find myself reaching out for the skip button or the volume button to control real life, sadly LG tone does not come equipped with those features. Maybe in the future.Anyway, this is pretty impressive. To my biggest surprise, the bass was better than any in-ear headphones I have purchased. (other than Beats Tour, but I felt like Beats was made purely for those that enjoy bass-heavy music) The sound quality is definitely not questionable.Above it all, Tone is extremely intuitive. It's extremely easy to use and the vibrating-notifications and SMS readings are just the cherry on top of the best guilty purchase ever.The only strange experience I have is when I have my phone/device connected in my pocket, and I put my hands in my pocket at the same time. The sound gets cut off erratically. I can tell that it's probably my hands blocking the device (like the grip of death for iphones several years ago) but all that is required is to transfer my phone into my purse.The preciseness of the range (33 feet) is quite creepy.

The first thing I did with this Acer was take it on an international flight and drop it onto a hardwood floor at a restaurant in the airport.  Though I didn't have it in a case, the Iconia was undamaged and works great to this day.  This Acer does everything I want it to do.  It has a very good display and plays movies flawlessly.  I completely recommend the Acer Iconia Tablet to anyone looking for a good tablet. ANSWERNOTFOUND

First thing before I write what I think about it, When you install the solid state drive, before installing your operation system, that you need to CHANGE the SATA configuration from IDE to ACHI. Once your operation system is installed it becomes much more difficult to do this.This drive is amazingly fast and I really like the Magician software. The software is some of the best for solid state drives that I have seen. The speed is amazing and with the software you can speed test the drive yourself. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I tried this out because it would be nice to see the keys in the dark (I always hate when I can't see the keys at night), but I don't care for the design.  There is not enough space in between the keys, and the keys feel like those of a laptop.  What I mean by that is that they aren't raised high enough.  I have big fingers and need keys that are spaced far enough apart and that are raised somewhat so it's comfortable to work with.  I'll stick to my old board. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Wow!  Others had commented on how small this 16gb usb drive was, but I didn't expect this small.  It can literally be difficult to get enough grip on the end to pull it out of the port.It's just what I wanted for music in my car.  It is so small that it doesn't get disturbed.  You can just leave it in the port since it doesn't stick out.  It's a huge amount of storage in a tiny package.  Performance is fine for playing music (standard usb 2.0).If you want small, you can't beat the SanDisk Cruzer Fit. ANSWERNOTFOUND

As others have mentioned the lens is quite solid but the hood is cheap feeling.  I got this for my D5100 to try to get some decent indoor volleyball pictures.  I wanted a fast lens with a little magnification for for action at about 10-30 meters range.  This lens does just what I wanted.  The magnification factor for an APS-c sensor  about right. If there are any distortions in the corners I won't notice them on my camera.  I don't think this lens is recommended for a full frame camera.The manual focus is smooth and doesn't pull.  I am still not sure this is the best lens for what I want since the DOF is only about a foot or two at 30 feet and f1.4.  That is just physics and nothing wrong with the lens itselfI plan on doing some portrait work with it in the near future and expect good things. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Have a couple of these in my house.  One in each bathroom to power an in-ceiling speaker and one that powers some outdoor speakers.  For the price you can not beat this.  They have enough power to get plenty loud and that's coming from a 26 year old who's been into sound systems his whole life.  They won't blow you away and the sound quality isn't anything to write home about, but for $20 it's more than enough.Depending upon what you have connected, these will go into protect mode if you turn them up to high.  The amp will basically shut itself off and then turn itself back on after a few seconds repeatedly until you lower the volume.  This is a good thing, otherwise you'd risk damaging the amp.

I bought this for a backup/walk around lens and for the price, i exactly got what i wanted. I've got the extra reach when i need it, light to carry around, easy to use, built strong. The only thing that i can probably complain about is, the image is a little bit too soft, but for the price, that's all i can get. So overall, i'll keep it. ANSWERNOTFOUND

And for the price just cant beat for the quality. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Didn't work. It took forever to arrive from China. I took a lose on the product. The seller said he would refund my money, if I first took back the negative feedback I gave them. They are in China , I'm in the U.S., I figured my chance of a refund was slim. I wasn't going to take back my feedback. If I save one person from such a negative experience, It would be worth my lose. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Finally we have a sizable amount of storage (2TB) in a compact shell. I no longer have to carry my huge 3.5&#34; extenal drives that need extra power. The 2TB portable 2.5&#34; external drive has a convenient small size outer shell with the added convience of a large 2TB storage capacity and do not require and extra plug. It draws its power source from the same USB plug source. Great for traveling! ANSWERNOTFOUND

I think plenty has been said about the technical pros and cons about this monitor, and I bought because (and despite) of those reviews, but an unexpected benefit of having this monitor was to be able to quickly see how a website behaves under a narrow and long viewport e.g. a smartphone screen.  Because the resolution of this isn't so great, it actually mimics a phone's dimensions a good bit when this is pivoted on its side.  Keep your Firebug-style inspector at the bottom and it becomes a great debugger for CSS when trying to see how different settings will behave on a phone. ANSWERNOTFOUND

January 22, 2013I purchased this from a local big box store as Amazon was out of stock at the time.I followed the very simple directions and it only took a few minutes for the router to set itself up and be operational. The web interface has a lot more features than most home users will need but you are not required to use them either if you follow the simple setup. I have Comcast and the router determined the network type and set itself up automatically.I do like how easy it is to create guest networks. This is a really great feature that you can add and delete them so quickly via the web interface.I looked at both N and AC routers and decided on the N due to the fact that the reviews on the AC, from Asus and other manufacturers were generally middle of the road to poor. The Asus N router had generally favorable reviews.There were some comments about the unit running hot and mine is warm to the touch.I'll update the review after I have used the router for awhile.

Im a little surprised at how people are just gushing about how great these are. Yeah they're good for the price but people are comparing them to high end earbuds and thats just crazy. I compared them to my soundmagic e10s which go for around 30 bucks. The panasonic earbuds don't even come close in terms of sound quality. The mids in particular are muddy. The panasonic earbuds will do if you're broke and just can't spend much money. Otherwise do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks on some soundmagic e-10, Jvc Ha-fx67 or MEElectronics CW31. You'll notice a big difference. Obviously, the more costlier earbuds are going to have better, and often multiple drivers. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Decided on this after going through some other reviews (especially the one where 3 other cases were compared).Leather feels good and sturdy but it doesn't make much sense to have included the blue sleeve since that would make it more inconvenient to have to take the case out of the sleeve before being able to use it. Maybe for storage purposes, but why would you want to put your $$$ iPad in storage?It feels nicely protected for the most part. I don't really mind the corners being exposed much since one corner houses the speakers and another corner is the sleep/lock button. Another corner is close to the earphone jack and I think it would be difficult to have those covered but have cutouts to access them especially since the leather is thick. I remember some cases have the earphone jack quite covered that it was hard to plug them in all the way.Only gripe I have is that the volume controls can be quite hard to get to but luckily I don't really need to change the volume often.

This ASUS router is a very attractive piece of electronic hardware, with its black diamond embossed plastic case.  It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).  Nevertheless, even with that omission, this is a great deal for the power, performance and range I get with this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I have been using hand held computers for a long time. If there is one lesson I have learned it is that the better the screen the better the experience. The screen on the new Nexus 7 is truly amazing. Resolution, contrast, saturation and responsiveness are all excellent. Add a fast processor, a full set of features and an ever improving operating system and interface and you have a product that is hard to beat at a great price.Installing the Dolphin browser with jetpack and Java and I am able to take full advantage of my prime membership without being locked into a Kindle Fire tablet with outdated Android versions. (I own the original Fire and like it but am fed up with not having the latest Android version.)I just wish Chromecast had more apps or that the Nexus built in support for  streaming all screen content.

great for the money and might order again if i needed a quick pair of headphones but even after little time using them my ears get sore. i've had earbud headphones before these are just like many of them , almost all hurt eventually at some point these are better than round plastic knockoffs and work great and sound good, at least has some good base. very cheap price so worth the money they are okay. I still use them, constantly going on walks or waiting time, works fine just ears probably aren't meant to have objects in them nor are they touched often so they are sensitive to the touch and earbuds rubbing on them for a hour will leave your ears kind of sore haha ANSWERNOTFOUND

It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time. The zoom, compactness, and fantastic video implementation are wonderful. Just don't pixel-peep at 100% or you'll be disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Np problems with this card whatsoever. However if your camera,is like mine, capable of using a CF card, spend the extra money and get that card. The problem with SD cards is simply they are not as sturdy and strong as their CF counter parts. A consideration for those instances when you can't afford to risk the images, or there is no chance to reshoot the event. ANSWERNOTFOUND
