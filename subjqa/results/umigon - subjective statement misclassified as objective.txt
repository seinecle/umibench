I think this is the smallest size possible for a usb flash drive. I bought this to store music and leave it plugged into my car's usb port. It is a little hard to remove once plugged in but I think it is a good thing. It has a small hole at the top for a string to be attached for easier removal. The tranfer rate is similar to an average usb drive and the price is very reasonable. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I owned a 1st generation Sansa and was very pleased with it.  It cost around $25.00 and lasted almost 3 years.  So when it quit working (rechargeable batteries are not replaceable by consumer), I was unconcerned that the price was then almost double.  Well, here is is just a bit over a year since purchase (less than 60 days), and it will no longer charge.  What really chaps my a--, is I went and looked up the warranty.  In the United States, the warranty is for 1 year.  If I was in Europe, the warranty is for 2 years.  So tell me Sansa, how do Europeans use the device differently to warrant a double warranty period?

Installed on system running Windows 7 x64 Ultimate.  Had ZoneAlarm Security Suite installed and the installation software would install but the unit would not see my router.  Contacted TP-LINK and after talking to one of their phone support tech, had gotten an RMA assuming the unit was defective.Not really wanting to ship the unit back to TP-LINK for a replacement, I did a bit of internet research and discovered that this unit has issues with ZoneAlarm Security Suite.  The write-up recommended uninstalling ZoneAlarm, installing the driver, then reinstalling ZoneAlarm.  I uninstalled ZoneAlarm and it took Windows 7 out with it.After reinstalling Windows 7, the TL-WN822N came up with signal strength 5 and is now working fine. ANSWERNOTFOUND

We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 3 year old after he loved playing with him mom's. The screen is clear, the sound is great and we love the Kindle Free Time application on the device. The ease with which he can use it is excellent. Also, we are seriously considering subscribing to the Kindle Free Time Unlimited service which we learned through a free trial has excellent apps available for children. We searched for other &#34;children's tablets&#34; as gifts, but the kindle is in our opinion, the best available option because it can be set up to work for little ones and changed as they grow!

This is a real handy device for those who do not like to train in groups but still want some competition during their training/work out.I waited for some time buying it because there was no Mac support. However now that that is available there was no need to hold off any more. The device has so many function that I am still trying to find out what I can do with it. Fortunately the many discussion groups give a lot of support in that matter.There is one thing that is a bit of a down point and that is the length of the straps. My wrists are slightly bigger than the average one and I  can hardly close it.In any way from now on I have a very strict trainer that tracks all my actions. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I decided to buy these despite the negative reviews, and I'm glad I did. They may not be the cadillac of in-ear earbuds, but they are well worth the $6 total cost. When I first stuck them in my ears, the words from the negative reviews rang true, but when I changed the shields to the larger size, it was a whole new experience.

I travel frequently for business and have been seeking a Bluetooth keyboard case for my iPad Air so that I do not have to bring my laptop everywhere. I have tried many of the other products on the market only to return them due to one issue or another. However, I have finally found a keeper with the New Trent Airbender 2.0. Straight out of the box you could tell that this was a quality item! Unlike competing products, this case has a very solid hinge that holds your iPad Air at any angle you choose. Additionally, you can alter the height which no other product offers.The keyboard connected seamlessly to my iPad and worked flawlessly during a 2 hour typing session.The case of this keyboard is tough and will absolutely protect my iPad.I have no reservations about protecting my iPad with this case.Overall, this item far exceeded my expectations!

This ASUS router is a very attractive piece of electronic hardware, with its black diamond embossed plastic case.  It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).  Nevertheless, even with that omission, this is a great deal for the power, performance and range I get with this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND

It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time. The zoom, compactness, and fantastic video implementation are wonderful. Just don't pixel-peep at 100% or you'll be disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought it at Sam's.  Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers.  As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC.  The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work.  The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet.  That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room.  That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to.  I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems.  However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000.  The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys.  The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000.  One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range).  However if you need a new keyboard on have an old mouse that's finicky of some surfaces, this keyboard may well suit your needs.Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 ANSWERNOTFOUND

This one is cheap, I thought it would be good to have. I've been bothered the most by the fact that it needs to be plugged into a USB port in order for it to work (or to a power outlet, meaning either an extra cord or less a USB port). The the thing is not that small to sit nicely plugged directly into the HDMI port.I was able to pair it, but I didn't see that much value in it. It feels like an experiment and it doesn't feel like an honestly advertised product.Granted I have different ways to enjoy my media already, so maybe I'm also spoiled.

If Canon were to ever be nervous about the competition in point and shoot camera's, they are likely crapping themselves at this moment.  I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice ANSWERNOTFOUND

[Edit 10/27/2013]After I began to edit the review, I thought it would be best to reopen the packed box and retest the tablet.  To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates "templates," the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]"Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store.

All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app."These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the "pleather" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought three of these cameras, the software is OK not too fancy but it works. Configuration is pretty straight forward but the operation is not what you can expect.I have to disconnect power cable every two days because they stop working, I contact FOSCAM company and they told me they cannot help customer that bought their products in stores different than the ones that they offer.The quality of the video is normal, poor compare with other camera systems that offer you similar prices.Basically, these cameras are cheap and you are getting exactly what you buy, cheap cameras that work in most of the cases with a little help from you. Just in case, I updated the camera firmware, even so, cannot get the camera to work more than three days in a roll, after disconnect and reconnect they start up normally and I can have my home security system back for other few days.

I started out with a Netgear WN 3000 RP which I used for more than a year. The Netgear extender constantly dropped connections and seemed to need a reboot every couple of days. I tinkered with it using different security levels and it never improved. Often the reboot wouldn't work and it wouldn't reconnect unless my main router also needed to be rebooted. I have a significant number of devices connected to wireless including an iPod, iPhone, and visitor smartphones. The reboots simply became more than inconvenient. They were extremely frustrating.It has now been a week since installation and I have not had a single dropped connection on any device. It is working perfectly! The setup was quick and easy. The touch screen made it straightforward and the setup process effectively did all the work for me. I have not noticed any degradation in speed between the main router and the extender. I have had no problems playing video clips. I'm sure there is some speed reduction but given my pattern of usage, I have not seen any problems.A bit pricey but I couldn't be happier so far.

I travel frequently for business and have been seeking a Bluetooth keyboard case for my iPad Air so that I do not have to bring my laptop everywhere. I have tried many of the other products on the market only to return them due to one issue or another. However, I have finally found a keeper with the New Trent Airbender 2.0. Straight out of the box you could tell that this was a quality item! Unlike competing products, this case has a very solid hinge that holds your iPad Air at any angle you choose. Additionally, you can alter the height which no other product offers.The keyboard connected seamlessly to my iPad and worked flawlessly during a 2 hour typing session.The case of this keyboard is tough and will absolutely protect my iPad.I have no reservations about protecting my iPad with this case.Overall, this item far exceeded my expectations!

I go through a lot of earbuds trying to find ones that have awesome sound.  So far, I have not heard anything better than those made by JVC!  I started with the Marshmallows and could not believe the sound they delivered for the price (now less than $10).  Not only that, but the fit made them just as good or better than other 'noise-cancelling' models I've tried.  I travel A LOT so I need something that will deliver strong, crisp, deep sound even when I'm sitting in a noisy airport or loud airplane.  These little guys deliver!  I saw them in the store for less than $20 so I just couldn't pass them up...especially with a name like Xtreme Xplosives.  They even come with a hard case for storage and different sizes of adapters to fit all ears.  At first glance, they seem pretty big for earbuds, but when you put them in your ear you hardly even notice the size...until you turn on your music - that's when you'll be blown away!  It seriously feels like there are 10" subwoofers sitting inside your ears!  These seal up really well also so I can't hear anything that's going on around me whenever the music is on; it's awesome!  Not only does the bass pound, but the mids and highs are also crisp/clear at all volume levels.  I've tried all of those high end brands (Klipsch, Bose, Beats, Koss, etc) and these are just as good or better at a fraction of the price!  My biggest disappointment was when I decided to try the Beats that everyone is walking around with these days.  After listening to them compared to these, there is absolutely no way I'd pay close to $200 for a pair of earbuds whose performance doesn't come close to these that are less than $30.  Don't waste your money on the high ends...buy these Xtreme earbuds (or any other JVCs for that matter) and you won't be disappointed! ANSWERNOTFOUND

I purchased a 16 and 32 gig of this flash drive.  I tried to transfer my files from my old 16 gig to the new 32 gig.  Transferred a few files then locked up.  Windows could not locate the drive.  Unplug, replug, Windows (7 64bit) finds it and I start copying again.  The same thing happens.  Tried this a couple more times.  The slow transfer time would have been tolerable if it would just complete the file transfer.  While copying it would say approx. 50 minutes to transfer 10 gigs.  It would run maybe 3 minutes and stop.  Small files would transfer succesfully.  Transferring a movie was out of the question.  I thought maybe this one was defective so I installed the 16 gig version.  I had the same problem.  So neither one are of any use to me. ANSWERNOTFOUND

One tiny nit - the Amazon description is incorrect - this is a 10.2-Inch case, not 10 inch.

This one is cheap, I thought it would be good to have. I've been bothered the most by the fact that it needs to be plugged into a USB port in order for it to work (or to a power outlet, meaning either an extra cord or less a USB port). The the thing is not that small to sit nicely plugged directly into the HDMI port.I was able to pair it, but I didn't see that much value in it. It feels like an experiment and it doesn't feel like an honestly advertised product.Granted I have different ways to enjoy my media already, so maybe I'm also spoiled. I own Apple products and I have an Apple TV, also the TV is a smart TV with USB ports and media sharing and I also use a PS3 for different media. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I've owned several brands of IEMs that I use mostly for the gym and listening to music at work without disturbing coworkers.Most IEMs last at least a year or two and then the damage from pulling, sweat, wear and tear etc kill them, which is to be expected. So I purchased these hoping that they would be more durable because of the construction and item description.I was wrong.It's only been 4 months and the bottom part of the cable already causes issues and will only work when held tightly, as headphones will do after years of use, not 4 months.The sound quality is just alright on these. I am a music producer so I know good from bad, and these are as meh as you can get. Not great bass, mids are decent, highs are good.

Most people writing reviews for this mouse have already raved about it- let me add my voice to the crowd.  I use a laptop for work every day, and always like to have a mouse as I don't like the eraser-head or the touch-pad nearly as much as an external mouse.  However, carrying a mouse around can be annoying.The Nano makes it less so- this mouse is ergonomically designed for true comfort.  My hands are fairly small, but I have no trouble reaching the very conveniently-placed buttons to navigate forward or backward, up or down.My favorite feature is the one-click button that you can press which will take you straight to your favorite Internet search engine!  This is a great feature when you have a lot of documents open already and don't want to minimize and go back to the desktop for your internet link!The mouse comes with a convenient carrying case, two AAA batteries, an optional desktop adapter and a CD for installation.  It is easy to install and takes absolutely no effort or reading of the instruction manual to work.  I am not at the forefront of the technological revolution by any means, but I enjoy comfort, simplicity and convenience in electronic accessories.  This mouse meets those requirements and for that, I would highly recommend it to anyone who prefers using a mouse to an eraser-head or touch-pad. ANSWERNOTFOUND

January 22, 2013I purchased this from a local big box store as Amazon was out of stock at the time.I followed the very simple directions and it only took a few minutes for the router to set itself up and be operational. The web interface has a lot more features than most home users will need but you are not required to use them either if you follow the simple setup. I have Comcast and the router determined the network type and set itself up automatically.I do like how easy it is to create guest networks. This is a really great feature that you can add and delete them so quickly via the web interface.I looked at both N and AC routers and decided on the N due to the fact that the reviews on the AC, from Asus and other manufacturers were generally middle of the road to poor. The Asus N router had generally favorable reviews.There were some comments about the unit running hot and mine is warm to the touch.I'll update the review after I have used the router for awhile.

Decided on this after going through some other reviews (especially the one where 3 other cases were compared).Leather feels good and sturdy but it doesn't make much sense to have included the blue sleeve since that would make it more inconvenient to have to take the case out of the sleeve before being able to use it. Maybe for storage purposes, but why would you want to put your $$$ iPad in storage?It feels nicely protected for the most part. I don't really mind the corners being exposed much since one corner houses the speakers and another corner is the sleep/lock button. Another corner is close to the earphone jack and I think it would be difficult to have those covered but have cutouts to access them especially since the leather is thick. I remember some cases have the earphone jack quite covered that it was hard to plug them in all the way.Only gripe I have is that the volume controls can be quite hard to get to but luckily I don't really need to change the volume often.

At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).  Nevertheless, even with that omission, this is a great deal for the power, performance and range I get with this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I have been using hand held computers for a long time. If there is one lesson I have learned it is that the better the screen the better the experience. The screen on the new Nexus 7 is truly amazing. Resolution, contrast, saturation and responsiveness are all excellent. Add a fast processor, a full set of features and an ever improving operating system and interface and you have a product that is hard to beat at a great price.Installing the Dolphin browser with jetpack and Java and I am able to take full advantage of my prime membership without being locked into a Kindle Fire tablet with outdated Android versions. (I own the original Fire and like it but am fed up with not having the latest Android version.)I just wish Chromecast had more apps or that the Nexus built in support for  streaming all screen content.

great for the money and might order again if i needed a quick pair of headphones but even after little time using them my ears get sore. i've had earbud headphones before these are just like many of them , almost all hurt eventually at some point these are better than round plastic knockoffs and work great and sound good, at least has some good base. very cheap price so worth the money they are okay. I still use them, constantly going on walks or waiting time, works fine just ears probably aren't meant to have objects in them nor are they touched often so they are sensitive to the touch and earbuds rubbing on them for a hour will leave your ears kind of sore haha ANSWERNOTFOUND

I purchased four of these for our IT department to use for installs and moving large files. After getting them out of the box we had issues when trying to move large files to them. It showed the space was available, but you would get an error saying not enough space. After reading other comments, saw that they don't come formatted correctly, so had to reformat all of them to NTFS. After doing this we are able to use them like any other flash drive.They seem to be fast for file transfers and I love the small size. Would highly recommend, only reason for taking a star off was due to the formatting issue. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I bought these thinking, what the heck? 20 bucks? And i was blown away with the sound quality, these headphones have incredible sound quality for an incredible price. They do not have a lot off bass, so all of you people looking for tons of bass, you won't get a ton of it here, but the bass present is rich and sounds great. ANSWERNOTFOUND

It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time. The zoom, compactness, and fantastic video implementation are wonderful. Just don't pixel-peep at 100% or you'll be disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND

This is a real handy device for those who do not like to train in groups but still want some competition during their training/work out.I waited for some time buying it because there was no Mac support. However now that that is available there was no need to hold off any more. The device has so many function that I am still trying to find out what I can do with it. Fortunately the many discussion groups give a lot of support in that matter.There is one thing that is a bit of a down point and that is the length of the straps. My wrists are slightly bigger than the average one and I  can hardly close it.In any way from now on I have a very strict trainer that tracks all my actions. ANSWERNOTFOUND

Np problems with this card whatsoever. However if your camera,is like mine, capable of using a CF card, spend the extra money and get that card. The problem with SD cards is simply they are not as sturdy and strong as their CF counter parts. A consideration for those instances when you can't afford to risk the images, or there is no chance to reshoot the event. ANSWERNOTFOUND

I got this as upgrade to my cheap microsoft set that was driving me crazy. The keys are quiet and mouse is accurate. Battery life lags if you try and use it for gaming and you will replace lots of batteries in the process. Great for just typing and surfing. ANSWERNOTFOUND
