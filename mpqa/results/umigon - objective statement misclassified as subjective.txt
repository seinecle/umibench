gold label was objective not subjective: 

 Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste. Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely. There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested.

Since the 11 September events in America, that country's administration has severely restricted the civil rights of the American people, particularly the foreigners residing in that country. It has done so through passing the anti-terrorism law, issuing presidential directives, and sending secret memoranda to the judiciary under the pretext of fighting terrorism. One such measure was a directive issued on 23 November concerning the creation of military courts for trying immigrants and foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. This has drawn a chorus of condemnation from the democrats in Congress, foreign governments and civil right activists in that country. According to the directive, which is considered by many American lawyers to be in contravention of the country's constitution, judicial investigations into the cases of the defendants in military courts will be conducted without any possibility of bail. Nor will they be allowed to appeal to American or international courts. Currently around 1,100 suspects, who are chiefly from Islamic Middle Eastern states, are being held in detention. They have been divested of many of their basis rights, and their voices cannot be heard by anyone. The decision by Bush to create a military court for the trial of terrorist suspects has prompted European states, particularly Spain, to refuse to hand over to America more than 10 individuals suspected of belonging to terrorist groups. They fear that these suspects may not receive a fair trial in America. America, which always accuses other countries of violating human rights, is today placing terrorist suspects, who may even be innocent, in solitary confinement without access to any means of mass communication, thus depriving them of the basic human rights, in contravention of its own constitution. And, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, it violates human rights - rights which are global. In the 23 November directive, Bush has in effect drawn a clear line between the rights of American citizens and foreign immigrants. This is a blatant case of discrimination in rights - something which is not practised anywhere else in the world. It is worth mentioning that in the past America had severely criticized and put pressure on other governments in the world for trying terrorist suspects in military courts. The American State Department had in 1999 condemned the government of Peru for the creation of a secret military court, and called on that country to accept international regulations, such as the need for open and fair trials and observance of defendants' basic rights. The recent action of the American president clearly demonstrates the need for the American administration to observe human rights. Moreover, it places this country, which claims to be a forerunner in the sphere of human rights in the world, in the same rank as countries which restrict civil rights under the pretext of security considerations. It appears that if the directive issued by Bush becomes law, then that country's re-entry into the UN Human Rights Commission, from which it was expelled this year, will become much more difficult.

December 5, was a Wednesday like any other for the 24 executive directors of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]. Three meetings - on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - under the chairmanship of the institution's director general, Germany's Horst Kohler, usually punctuate their weekly schedule. During these meetings, they review various subjects and in particular the achievements of "under program" countries. That particular morning, it was Argentina's turn. It is the victim of an explosive situation at the economic, political and social levels. And yet, the problem was disposed of in two hours. Since the economic targets the government had promised, particularly the one on a zero budget deficit, were not reached, the board felt it was unable to "recommend" releasing a new $1.264 billion tranche that had been scheduled for December as part of last year's $22 billion program for Argentina.

 Regarding the major contents and purpose of Bush's speech at Tsinghua University, it was, as overseas public opinion had expected, a promotion of US values to China. In an editorial, Hong Kong's Shang Pao pointed out that in the course of reform and opening up, the United States is a country that the Chinese people want to understand the most and that the United States is a country that is easiest to understand. Not only today, 10 years ago or even in the early days of China's reform and opening up, the broad mass of the Chinese people, young college students in particular, know about US values. The Chinese people not only understand American democracy, freedom, religions, and human rights, they also know quite well about American social, economic, and political problems, which is beyond Bush's imagination. That's why a student asked Bush yesterday how to handle social problems including the problem of the violation of human rights, which is getting worse day after day in the!

 The fact that the President reconsidered his own statement of 18 January led to diverse reactions. There is irony -- including from the sober The New York Times , which wrote in its Tuesday issue that in his Monday speech the President "twice called the 158 pro-Taliban fighters 'prisoners,' then stopped himself, and used the word 'detainees.'" At first sight, this seems to be nothing more than a terminology issue. However, I believe it is more than that. In this concern about details -- about cold-blood accomplices to murder, because that is what these al-Qa'ida disciples at Guantanamo Bay are -- the US Administration proves it is capable of admitting it is not infallible, which is the equivalent of respect for democracy. And, as a last detail, let us remember that, harassed everywhere by journalists and commentators, no US leader ever thought of finding "monkeys" [reference to a statement made by Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase] among media workers or scapegoats among the weirdoes who use hundreds of websites to call on the administration to stop supporting the Jews or to exterminate the Arabs.

 The Kazakh Oil national oil company's enterprises produced 4.9m t of oil in the [first] nine months of this year, that is 11.6 per cent up year on year. The extraction of oil over and above the plan - 336,000 t - was possible due to the launching of new wells and measures taken to intensify the production process, the company's press service reports. An increase in the extraction was possible thanks to the company's active investment policy which has been conducted since 2000, the press service says. Capital investments in production increased by 37 per cent in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period of 2000. Capital was invested in renewing the main facilities, increasing volumes of drilling and wells and upgrading them. The company processed 1,697,000 t of oil and fully provided the Atyrau oil refinery [in the west of the country] with oil. Kazakh Oil paid more than 34bn tenge [the current exchange rate is 148 tenge to the dollar] to the budget in the period, that is 60 per cent up year on year...

 As for all the ideas regarding blocking shields, umbrellas and the like, I will answer this way. The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change. There are no proposals there to erect screens or to shoot cooling aerosols into the atmosphere. Already everything humankind does causes incredible damage to nature. We emit greenhouse gases, we thaw out the frozen regions that emit methane, we destroy forests, and in the south, deserts are expanding, a process that alters the heat exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. That is, all of our actions are accompanied by a deterioration in the climate. In this situation it is very frightening to do anything else -- for example, to suspend some umbrella, screen or something else in that vein.

[First announcer] Hugo Chavez was ousted today as a result of a coup d'etat. Please pay attention to a commentary on this issue. [second announcer] In a rare development, which reminds one of the American-backed coup d'etat by General Pinochet against the legally-elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende, in 1973, the legally-elected President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was ousted as a result of coordinated operations carried out by a number of army generals, as well as prominent industrialists, capitalists and forces acting as American agents. Venezuela is one of the largest oil producers and exporters in the world. It has vast natural resources and riches. However, despite the passage of 170 years since its independence, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. More than 80 per cent of its population live below the poverty line. Indeed, that is the fate of many Latin and South American countries which have been living for decades under American-backed military regimes that oppressed their own peoples. [passage omitted: On developments in Venezuela after World War II] As a result of developments in the 1990s, Hugo Chavez was elected in the free elections held in 1998. He gained the votes of the vast majority of voters and immediately declared that the aim of his government was to eliminate poverty and injustice and guarantee the independence of his country in the face of foreign interference. Chavez's policies were aimed at eliminating injustice and poverty in his country. Thus he introduced reforms in the economic and commercial arenas, as well as in the oil [industry]. As a result, industrialists and prominent capitalists, as well as defeated political forces acting as foreign agents and the military figures associated with them, became concerned about the situation. Gradually, this led to the formation of a coalition. Indeed, the officials of the Chavez government repeatedly said that foreign intelligence agencies were involved in the formation of that coalition. As far as the issue of foreign policy was concerned, Chavez sought to preserve the independence of his country in the face of American pressure. He pursued an independent policy. One of the main objectives of his policies was to properly utilize Venezuela's vast natural riches, namely oil. In this way, he sought to implement his policy of eliminating poverty. Moreover, Chavez's foreign policies were contrary to American interests in Latin America, as well as in other parts of the world. In Latin and South America, Hugo Chavez established close and friendly relations with Cuban President Fidel Castro and invited him to visit his country. He also supported movements that opposed American intervention in the region, thereby infuriating Washington. That was particularly because his policies enjoyed widespread support among regional countries. Washington was concerned that the Chavez model might affect other [Latin] American countries. Moreover, America also openly opposed Chavez's policies of establishing friendly relations with certain countries that pursued independent regional and international policies. Nevertheless, the most important reason for America's concern was the issue of oil. This issue is closely intertwined with America's policies towards the Middle East. Following Iran's proposal on cutting off the supply of oil to countries that support Israel for one month, which was supported by some oil-exporting countries, there was an increasing probability that Venezuela would also support [the proposal]. Therefore, the ouster of the Chavez government was an effective solution. It also served the interests of the forces that opposed Chavez inside [Venezuela]. Therefore, it seems that the coup d'etat in Venezuela should be assessed as a plot that was hatched for that purpose.

 Beijing, Jan. 12 (Yonhap) -- Criminals have been increasingly preying on Korean travellers and residents in China with the increase of exchanges between the two countries since the opening of diplomatic relations in 1992. Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said. Missing passports find their way to human traffickers, he said.

 It is due to this hegemony, which the United States wants to maintain, that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world. The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment. After the 11 September events, the United States completely ignored the international convention of human rights and by doing so negated its own constitution. After the events in Washington and New York, approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail, and one person, Mohammed Butt, died of heart failure during detention. No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves. Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba. These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there. As a lesson to others!

 According to a report, a majority of the residents even within the United States are denouncing Bush's reckless remarks. As a matter of fact, the fellow who wrote Bush's address inevitably submitted his resignation. Foreign news reported that the US White House announced that David Frum, a White House official who wrote President Bush's address, had submitted his resignation. This, in fact, signifies that he inevitably had to leave the White House, driven out by the anti-Bush hot winds from around the world. The US imperialist war maniacs are clinging to a new conspiracy in order to escape such a predicament and divert the arrows aimed at them in other directions. What they have crafted out of this was our so-called sales of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] and ballistic missiles and concerned technology sales. In order to add credibility to the US imperialist war maniacs' conspiracy, they did not forget to label our country as the number one country in WMD and ballistic missiles sales and concerned technology sales that were already mentioned. How accustomed they are to trickery! However, no one will fall for their acts.

 Moscow, 21 January: President Vladimir Putin visited the Khrunichev space centre on Monday evening [21 January]. In one of the workshops, he was told in detail about manned and unmanned spacecraft. The centre's chief, Aleksandr Medvedev, reported to the president about the development of Russia's segment on board the International Space Station [ISS]. Rosaviakosmos Director Yuriy Koptev, in his turn, told the president that, at present, Russia was actively interacting with European countries on "the interchangeability" of the ISS' American segment. Koptev explained that the USA has suspended the ISS development programme until a deficit of 4.7bn dollars is paid off. According to Koptev, such interaction with Europe would make it possible for six spacemen to be on board the ISS rather than the current three, as well as to use a Russian Soyuz rocket as a rescue spaceship. The director-general of the Khrunichev centre briefed the head of state on how the heavy Proton rocket-booster had been upgraded. According to the director, it is this rocket booster that launches almost all of Russia's military and civilian satellites into space. According to Medvedev, the main upgrading work included "the replacement of the control system, improvement of design data, the determination of ecological measures at the first stage, and the improvement of the rocket-booster at the boosting unit's expense." The upgrading and especially the last part - the boosting unit - have made it possible "to surge on the foreign market" and provided for a great economic and commercial effect from the launch of an upgraded Proton rocket-booster, said Medvedev. In all, since the first launch of Proton in 1965, according to Medvedev, 284 launches of this rocket have been made, all from the Baykonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Accompanying the president at the Khrunichev centre are Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, deputy chief of Presidential Administration, Sergey Prikhodko; chief of staff, Anatoliy Kvashnin, presidential assistant, Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, Deputy Defence Minister Aleksey Moskovskiy and Space Forces Commander Anatoliy Perminov.

MOSCOW. March 24 (Interfax) - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov on Sunday evening is beginning a foreign tour, during which he will pay official visits to Mongolia and Vietnam. He will be visiting Ulan-Bator on March 25 and 26, and Hanoi on March 26 to 28. In Mongolia Kasyanov is to meet with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar, parliament Chairman Timur Ogir and President Natsagiyin Bagabandi. The plan of Kasyanov's visit also included expanded talks and the signing of bilateral documents. The Russian prime minister will meet with Mongolian and Russian businessmen. The main goal of the visit is to broaden economic cooperation between the two countries, whose present-day pace is not fast enough. Russian-Mongolian trade currently amounts to $240 million and makes up only 25% of Mongolia's foreign trade turnover. Mongolia's negative balance in trade with Russia increased from $150 million in 2000 to $160 million in 2001. Russia has proposed improving the situation by increasing exports of Mongolian meat to Russia. In recent years, three joint ventures - the Erdenet mining company, the Mongolian-Russian Non-Ferrous Metals Company and the Ulan- Bator Railways, have accounted for 60% of the Mongolian exports and 40% of the GDP. Russia would like to increase its stake in Erdenet from the current 49%, but Mongolia is also interested in increasing its 51% stake. This issue is likely to be discussed in Ulan-Bator, since the 1991 agreement on this company expires on December 31, 2002. Among other projects which Russian companies would like to implement in Mongolia are the laying of a gas pipeline from Russia to China (Yukos), the gasification of individual districts of Mongolia (Gazprom, Itera) and electricity exports to Mongolia (Unified Energy Systems of Russia.) Mongolia is one of the few members of the former social camp to which Russia does not owe anything. On the contrary, Mongolia's debt to Russia on current operations amounts to $10 million, and its Soviet-era debt to $11.5 billion. Russia is prepared to discuss restructuring and deferment schemes with the Mongolian leadership. Military cooperation, curtailed in the 1990s and now being resumed, will also be on the agenda. The parties are to discuss the training of Mongolian military personnel at Russian military academies and arms exports. Kasyanov will fly to Hanoi from Ulan-Bator on March 26.

"There is concern over a degeneration of the democratic process in Argentina," the president stated, according to two of the meeting's participants. The Argentine question was raised by the president of the Swedish Trade Council, Ulf Dinkenspiel. He said he believed that the risk of contagion in the region has been overcome, but he asked President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was in Argentina before traveling to Europe, for a more complete evaluation. The Brazilian president said that a solution for Argentina, even over a longer term, is not a sure thing, due to the institutional risk.

 According to this expert, the United States is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world. And its total emissions continue to rise. In March, the new Bush Administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the "Kyoto Protocol." Its excuses include that it will harm the US economy and there is insufficient participation by developing nations. Dr. Ren was critical of this irresponsible decision by the US Government. He indicated that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is accumulated over the past 100-200 years. The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission. This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations. Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations. China's per capita emission is only one-sixth that of the United States. It mainly requires the joint effort of industrialized nations to resolve global warming. It is a mistake for the United States to use such an excuse to evade its responsibility.

 The carrier rocket is the foundation of space exploration and utilization. It is also the first hurdle to overcome to realize any astronautical program. Japan previously developed the L and M series of launch vehicles. However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites. In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket. The major performance characteristics of the H series rocket are comparable to those developed by the United States and some European nations. The Japanese aerospace community takes a great deal of pride in this achievement.

"Those out of work now, who rely on benefits to support their families, will find themselves in an even worse situation," he said. "This is likely to have ramifications for the future, with children skipping school, going out onto the streets, and getting mixed up with crime, drugs, and violence.

In 1987, they revolted, resorting to stones, demonstrations and strikes, and the Israelis responded swiftly by breaking their limbs and shooting unarmed civilian demonstrators in cold blood.

This is another diversionary tactic to divert the criticism of people around the world, which was provoked by the fact that Bush had made an announcement on an axis of evil and it had caused a great controversy to the world, to us.

 It is hard not to see a desire for revenge in cages which recall 'Hotel Hanoi', set up by the North Vietnamese, or the punishment cells in Japanese camps in the 'Bridge on the River Kawi.' Even its most loyal ally, Great Britian, is showing signs of disquiet in the statements made by its members of parliament, and in the reports carried by its media. The BBC has been posing questions about those photos which "are stirring up protests," and many people believe them to be "a scandal": photos taken in part at the landing of the C17s after the trip from Afghanistan, which already showed the prisoners reduced to objects, with gags, masked goggles, and ear muffs. "Those people were ready to gnaw through the cables of the C17 to make it crash," said Richard Myers, the Chief of Staff. "They are pictures which do not represent everyday life at the camp. They wore the muffs and the goggles during the trip. And the masks are to prevent tuberculosis from spreading," assured the commander of X-Ray, Brigadier General Mike Lehnert. But the head of the medical staff of Amnesty International, Jim West, has claimed that "there is no other explanation for these measures than the attempt to degrade the human condition." "I am shocked -- he said -- because they still wear the ear muffs and the goggles inside the camp. As for the hospital masks, it is highly unlikely that tuberculosis can spread in open places." Other human rights groups have talked in terms of "sensory segregation,'" "In that condition, you suffer from hallucinations," stated Helen Bamber, from the Medical Foundation for Protecting Victims of Torture, on television. Four envoys from the Red Cross arrived Saturday, and will talk with the prisoners. But 'torture' is a word which is now filtering through in insidious fashion.

 There are several models today, and they answer the question of why the climate is changing with varying degrees of persuasiveness. Why don't I have the sense that the models explain everything?

But to what extent does this reflect real life? Nevertheless, the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous. Our institute, along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center, has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development. There are no results to speak of yet, but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared.

Moscow, May 8, IRNA -- Deputy head of the Russian Geopolitical Research Institute Lyonid Ivashev said on Wednesday the United States sees part of an axis of evil any country which does not follow the its policies. Talking to IRNA, Ivashev expressed regrets over the fact that the people in some parts of the world are indifferent toward the expansionist policies of the United States and do not proceed to condemn them. He strongly criticized the US war-mongering actions and tactics and said the US war-mongering has posed serious threats to the world. He said the United States has turned into an axis of evil itself and is ignoring even the resolutions issued by the United Nations. Ivashev further said Russia is to develop its relations with the Muslim nations as well as China and India. He said there are deep differences between Russia and the United Stats on a range of strategic, political and economic issues. He said the US officials claim as for the countries described as "parts of an axis of evil" are "unfounded" and the US claims in this connection are "sheer lies". Reacting to the threats launched by the US president George W. Bush against Iran he condemned the United States expansionist policies. US President George W. Bush had in his State of the Union address termed Iran, Iraq and North Korea as "axis of evil" and accused them of attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction. Ivashev further said the United States is after gaining superiority over Russia's nuclear capabilities and initiating an anti-missile defense system by the United States shows that country's intentions. He said the United States is after imposing its expansionists policies under the pretext of the fight against terrorism.

 Perhaps it is perverse to have rules for warfare. But the world is a perverse place. And so, since the late 19th century, most nations that call themselves civilized have adhered to such rules. The 1949 Geneva Convention specifies that any belligerents captured in the course of war - be they regular soldiers, militia members or volunteers "operating in or outside their territory even if this territory is occupied" - must be accorded prisoner of war status. The convention exempts only those, such as spies and saboteurs, who do not clearly identify themselves as belligerents. But clearly it was meant to apply to the Taliban and Al Qa'ida fighters captured after vicious battles in Afghanistan, fighters who made no secret of who they were, what they were supporting and who they thought their enemies were.

 Moscow, 24 March: Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is departing for Mongolia on Sunday afternoon [25 March] on an official visit, the premier's press secretary, Tatyana Razbash, told ITAR-TASS. The official programme of Kasyanov's stay in capital Ulaanbaatar will begin with a tete-a-tete meeting with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enhbayar on Monday, followed by talks in an extended format and signing of several agreements. Besides this, the Russian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Mongolian President Natsagiyn Bagabandi and the parliamentary speaker, Sanzhbegiyn Tumur-Ochir. On Tuesday, 26 March, Kasyanov will address Russian and Mongolian entrepreneurs and visit Science and Technology University. He is also expected to be awarded the title of honorary doctor of the university. On Tuesday night, Kasyanov will wind up his Mongolian tour and leave for Vietnam for an official visit. The turnover of goods between Russia and Mongolia has reached 240m dollars. Russia exports petroleum products, electricity, machinery and equipment to Mongolia and imports copper concentrate and meat. Moscow has expressed the wish to import more Mongolian meat. Russia's Ambassador to Mongolia Oleg Derkovskiy believes that there are no problems in relations between the two states and the common border stretching for 3,500 kilometres is a border of peace and good neighbourliness. Moscow and Ulaanbaatar are continuing a political dialogue, actively developing bilateral trade, and consulting each other on international problems where their stands coincide or are close. At the same time, the ambassador said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that large Russian capital and businesses "are not active enough in dealings with Mongolia" at the moment.

 Accordingly, Russia has joined the anti-terrorist coalition of the United States virtually without reservation. Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side. He wanted to become an ally, and that's what he has become. But making this complex decision was not easy for him. Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of "the rare opportunity for (Russia) to become integrated with the civilized world." But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America, the country that has been historically responsible for "educating" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan. In the end, a certain consideration that differed from the above two proved to be decisive. It had to do with Chechnya. Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of "international terror." He did not succeed with that so far. He was criticized more than recognized for his policy. At this time however, he taught a lesson to the Americans. After the Americans had promised everything good and nice, Putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in Chechnia "could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism." In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way. Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington, namely, that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents. Nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to "unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups," and that they accept Putin's offer to make peace. If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind "Chechen terrorism," we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views.

 Addressing Friday worshippers gathered at Tehran University, Iran's former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday criticized the treatment of Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in Guantanamo military base in Cuba. The former president and current chairman of the Expediency Council said that these prisoners are put in chain, in cages in summer and in winter. He said that the Americans are treating these prisoners like "an ostrich". They neither believe that these prisoners are truly prisoners, nor do they believe that they are "captives." After pointing its finger of blame at tens of regimes and governments around the world for decades. Washington needs to review its own history of crimes against humanity, especially the non-WASP humanity. What is non-WASP humanity? Non-White Anglo-Saxon-Protestant humanity is that part of humanity whose eyes are not bluest of the blue and whose hair is not blondest of the blonde. According to Americans, this sort of humanity does not qualify for any of the laws that have been legislated by international organizations, by any accepted world conventions. (John Walker, "the American Taleban" has not been taken to Guantanamo because he is not part of the non-WASP humanity). The treatment of Al-Qa'idah and Taleban prisoners will go down in history as the most shameful detentions in the history of post-war incarceration in the 21st century. The US President George W. Bush has said that he does not recognize the detainees in Guantanamo military base as war captives, and hence he will not accord them the rights and privileges that they would automatically get under Geneva Convention. The argument by Bush is that these detainees are members of a terrorist group and hence they do not qualify as members of a defeated country or an army. Even if we assume that George W. Bush has a point in making this argument, it is not up to him to decide who is a captive or who is not a captive. An international tribunal consisting of experts on international law should decide on this issue, not Mr. Bush whose knowledge of international law leaves plenty to be desired. The world is watching how the US is treating the detainees in Guantanamo. The world well remembers how the United States has been calling other countries as violators of human rights, while it has been involved in one of the grossest type of human rights violations. The case of the United States is like the case of that pot who called the kettle black. If the United States is truly committed to human rights, it should show it in its treatment of the detainees that it has transported in chain to another side of the globe. This is in no way defending the Taleban or the Al-Qa'idah members, some of whom might be guilty of the most heinous crimes against the poor oppressed people in Afghanistan. The point is that if the United States keeps pontificating and preaching about human rights, it can't suddenly forget about its past lectures to other countries and nations. [end]

 An outbreak of a highly contagious type of tuberculosis has been reported in Embu [central Kenya]. Health authorities said yesterday that more than 27 people had tested positive for the severe sputum smear type of tuberculosis. A TB expert, Dr Joel Kangangi, said one person infected with the bacteria could spread it to more than 10 people in a day. The doctor, however, said no deaths had been reported. The worst affected areas are Dallas, Majengo and the Shauri Yako slums with a population of 17,000 people. Dr Kangangi, an assistant director of medical services attached to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme, said 56 per cent of those infected with TB were also HIV-positive. Health personnel have been deployed to the affected areas to carry out random screening of residents to contain the outbreak. Yesterday, Dr Kangangi carried out random checks on hundreds of residents in Dallas estate. He was accompanied by the Embu Medical Officer of Health, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, and a team of health personnel. The medic blamed the outbreak on congestion in the slums and failure to observe basic hygienic practices. The residents are being advised to ensure that their houses were well ventilated to avoid multiplication of germs. They are also being advised to seek medical attention immediately they detect symptoms of the disease. The symptoms include prolonged cough, chest pains, fever and loss of weight and appetite.

By publicly designating countries and their peoples, not some terrorist elements or organizations, enemies of mankind, the United States is taking the risk of confronting itself with all the other countries in the world.

We do not know how Europe will develop towards southeast and east 15 or 20 years later.``

 And now Andrey Gudkov, an expert at the Center for Strategic Studies, follows Budyko in insisting that Russia, as well as Canada and Alaska, gain, since "lands situated in a condition of permafrost will gradually turn into fertile soils for agricultural production." But the rich Russian fields that stretch across the Arctic zone are small comfort to humankind as a whole, so Gudkov proposes blocking off the sun with an umbrella that would be suspended in space. The expert immediately sketched on a blackboard what this should look like, mixing up chemical symbols: rockets would carry metallic sodium into orbits around the earth. Cooling aerosols dispersed over the polar zones would prevent overheating of the tundra during sunny summer nights.

 In his fellow countrymen's eyes, the test constituted by 11 September has revealed George Bush's talents as a war leader. He is clearly more comfortable in this role than he is in he management of routine matters. His force of conviction when he preaches the struggle of good against evil largely explains his exceptional popularity ratings (83 percent of favorable opinions, according to the latest ABC and Washington Post surveys.) So on Tuesday evening George Bush tried to reproduce the tone of his 20 September speech in order to galvanize the country. "The United States will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the most destructive weapons. Whatever the cost of our country's defense, we will pay it. The evil is real, and it must be combated... even in the midst of tragedy, specially in the midst of tragedy, God is there..."

Today the Council of EU environment ministers adopted the Commission's proposal for a decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The European Commission strongly welcomes this decision. By taking this decision, the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing multilateral solutions to issues of global concern. With its decision to ratify the protocol at EU level, the European Union stays true to its ambition to enable the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August/September 2002. The decision also makes the Member States' greenhouse gas reduction commitments (the so-called "Burden-Sharing Agreement") agreed in June 1998 legally binding. The EU continues to call for the United States to participate in the global framework for addressing climate change.

 "No withholding on oil exports: In conclusion, the government has decided to reverse itself on the 20 percent tax that it was planning to levy on these exports. 'We would not have raised all that much money and would have been sending a very bad signal overseas by discriminating between sectors,' acknowledged a senior source in the Economy Ministry. In any event, the oil industry may be asked for an advance on taxes due, as had been under consideration a couple of weeks ago. If any withholding arrangement is implemented, it will apply to all exports, not just some.

 Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome. Anti-submarine combat strength is extremely low, and in particular there are many old style naval aircraft that, compared to Japan, are possibly 30 to 40 years behind. Torpedo strength is also insufficient. The Navy's problems are very large. For example, there is only one submarine attached to each naval base. It can only be said that this is nothing more than an embellishment and fundamentally cannot accomplish anything. Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength. In past Taiwan-US arms sale negotiations, the PC-3 early warning aircraft and the MH53 helicopter that Taiwan has made requests to purchase are entirely suitable to Taiwan's needs. The PC-3's intelligence exchange system is extremely important and is not inferior to the Aegis destroyer.

 Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela. They have pointed out: When will a "coup" not be called a "coup"? It will not be a "coup" so long as the United States thinks it is not! According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms. This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days. When questioned by a reporter "why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America," Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator "may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch."

Islamabad, March 6, IRNA -- Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul on Wednesday rejected this year's US State Department report on human rights, saying it was "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." A former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Hameed Gul told IRNA in an interview here that each country which resisted American hegemony was deemed a violator of human rights. "In a fit of force, the US wanted to subjugate the entire world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in this direction and the recent report on human rights was also a manifestation of its hegemonistic designs," the lieutenant general (retd) continued. Hameed Gul was of the opinion that the US was the only country in the world that had no respect for any religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights and rules. "It is unprecedented in the history of the comity of nations that the US forcibly wanted to prevent countries from upholding religious and cultural values," he said. "The US is the most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country. The world would never forget the barbarities it committed on the innocent Afghan people, women, children and the elderly," he firmly said. In order to realize its vested interests in the region, he said the US and its allies unleashed oppression against the Afghan people and used latest weaponry against the defenseless nation. In this regard, he made a quick reference to the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims. "Since the rioting erupted last week, over 600 people, mostly Muslims, have been brutally murdered in the hands of extremist Hindus in India, but the US and other so-called civilized nations kept a shameful mum," he remarked. The Americans, he pointed out, see violations of human rights when a country or a group of people become hurdles in the realization of their vested interests. "What Israel is doing in Palestine against the Muslims is also one of the worst examples of rights abuses but the US is again silent, but when Palestinians react to Israeli attacks America is quick to The logical solution to the Palestinian issue is a free and independent state for the people of Palestine as enshrined under UN resolutions, he said. But the US is denying this, he added. He said it clearly means that the Muslims have no right to defend themsleves against their oppressors. "America wants total submission of Muslims across the globe," Hameed Gul said. "The situation requires a concerted moral resistance by Muslims scholars; if they remain indifferent to each other's plight in the hands of imperialist forces led by the US, they would be crushed one by one," he warned. Muslims rulers should forge unity in their ranks to resist the ever-increasing US influence; otherwise, they would be targeted one by one, Hameed Gul concluded.

 Vladimir Putin was insistently asked to tackle another of Russia's space problems yesterday. According to Rosaviakosmos Head Yuriy Koptev, he and his colleagues had "informed the president" of their wish that the program for the development of the Plesetsk space center be given federal status. In the future, Russia is planning to gradually transfer all launches from Kazakhstan's Baykonur onto its own territory. This is connected both with considerations of economy ($115 million has to be paid every year just to lease Baykonur) and with the problem of the country's "space sovereignty": After all it is only possible to guarantee to ensure the launches of commercial devices from your own territory. Incidentally, the president was reminded about "space sovereignty" on Monday before his visit to the center. During the talks with his Turkmen colleague that took place immediately before it, the head of state had to discuss an agreement to pay Ashgabat financial compensation for the use of so-called "fall sites": Three Turkmen regions (with a total area of over one million hectares) on which the spent rocket stages fall after being launched from Baykonur (the stipulated size of payment for a single use of the regions comes to around $70,000).

 During a general warming, completely opposite phenomena take place. In the polar regions, climate changes are more pronounced than in the middle latitudes. As a result, the temperature doesn't change much in the equatorial and middle latitudes but changes a great deal in the polar regions. What does this lead to? Dispersion is less active, and so-called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often. We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia. Incidentally, last year's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property. Because, strange as it may seem, prolonged, stagnant cold spells are also a result of global warming when there is less ventilation of the atmosphere as a whole.

 But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation. Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict. The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population. Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part.

 To be more precise, prisoners of war are not to be treated like those jailed by the U.S. at its Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Those detainees, brought shackled, shaved and blindfolded to Cuba, are kept in chain link pens under the constant glare, night and day, of halogen lamps. (The blindfolding, deliberate disorientation, discomfort and constant light are staples of police states all over the world. The idea is to break down the inmate, weaken him from lack of sleep and thereby make him more pliable when the interrogators begin their serious work). Washington is brazen about its flouting of international law, secure in the knowledge that neither its citizens not its allies will complain. Indeed, many Americans (and some Canadians) probably think anyone connected to the Sept. 11 terror attacks deserves whatever he gets.

 About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit. That was with the US Atlantis shuttle. In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit. It will be a mission that will be rich in promises. De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting. He will become one of the best elements in the corps of European astronauts. In addition, he will carry the projects of Belgian scientists and industrialists active in the space sector far. As Picque emphasized, "for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs." Who said that space investments were not interesting?

 Washington, March 4 (Yonhap) -- The U.S. State Department published its annual human rights country report Monday, reconfirming poor human rights conditions in North Korea. The "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001," submitted to Congress, said North Korea's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. It also estimated that anywhere from several hundreds of thousands to two million people died from starvation and related diseases. Other human rights abuses in the North included extrajudicial executions and disappearances. "Citizens are detained arbitrarily, and many are held as political prisoners and prison conditions are harsh. The constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary and fair trials are not implemented in practice," the report said. On the other hand, the report described South Korea as "generally respecting the human rights of its citizens" although problems remain in some areas. The report pointed out as "remaining problems" in South Korea, police's physical or verbal abuses of detainees at times and the National Security Law (NSL)'s infringement upon free expression and other civil liberties. Other problems cited in the report include domestic violence, rape, child abuse, legal and societal discrimination against women and ethnic minorities. In particular, trafficking in persons was a problem. South Korea was cited in the report as a "major transit point for alien smugglers, including traffickers of primarily Asian women and children for the sex trade and domestic servitude." The report, however, noted the government has taken various steps to improve its human rights record. It also noted President Kim Dae-jung stated repeatedly that promoting the rights of women was a priority goal. In connection with freedom of speech and press, the report said the Seoul government abandoned direct control over the news media, but it continues to exercise indirect influence, and government officials vigorously lobby reporters and editors. It cited controversial massive tax probes of media firms which critics accused of being an attempt to curb media criticism of the government while the government maintained the tax audit was a legitimate activity and long overdue. Meanwhile, the report called Afghanistan "a triumph for human rights in 2001," saying that after the U.S.-led war on terrorism, Afghan citizens have been released from the brutal and oppressive rule of the Taliban and Afghan women, who suffered violence and repression, are now beginning to resume their roles in society. The report also noted improvement in human rights records in such countries as Bahrain, Peru, Qatar and Oman. cjs2001@yna.co.kr

 In addition to the suggestion from the sixth continent, it is a good idea to recall the Great Flood, which has been depicted, apart from the Bible, in many of the world's mythologies: "What was it? Before predicting the future, we must learn how to predict the past," Kapitsa summed up. In his view, it would not be a bad idea, when the scientific community draws up all sorts of forecasts and plans of action that flow out of them, for it to seek help from the science of paleoclimatology and to gain a broad understanding of its data.

 In order to compete with the United States, Europe, and China, Japan decided to drastically reduce its costs, especially in every aspect of rocket design and manufacture. It adopted the simplest design and implemented various cost-cutting measures in an attempt to lower the manufacturing cost per satellite from 19 billion yen to 9 billion yen. It is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable. However, things did not go according to plan. This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures. In November 1999, a "multi-purpose" satellite was launched by H2 rocket No. 8. It did not enter its predetermined orbit and had to be destroyed. This was the third failure in a row. After this incident, Japan began to redesign the main engine of the H2 rocket. Eventually, the H2A rocket was developed.

 The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution. Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and, more exactly, they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago. This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of "divide and rule." It actually reflects Israel's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole. The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities. The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence. The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities. Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception.

You can never be too sure about what you are communicating.

At the end of a brilliantly waged and very carefully framed war, punctuated by briefings that had brought Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, a veritable media triumph, there was this one image too many.
