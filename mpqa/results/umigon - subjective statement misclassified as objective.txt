 The same situation arises if the President dies while in office. Never again should Zimbabweans go into an election under the current constitution.

 A YEAR after gently attempting to nudge Zimbabwe's government into embracing minimum conditions that allow for a free and fair presidential election, several local and international groups find themselves back to square one, unable to move the Harare authorities even an inch. Several diplomatic missions from organisations such as the European Union (EU), the Commonwealth, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and Africa's powerhouse Nigeria have come and gone from Harare empty-handed.

 In all likelihood, President Bush made that statement on 18 January following a consultation -- which was "rather brief," some US observers believe -- with Ashcroft, who was strongly supported by Cheney. Obviously, this decision simplified things, and it allowed the US judiciary to conduct the investigation of the 158 detainees as it sees fit. The United States wanted this very much, because so far the identity and citizenship of those they call "terrorists" (or "killers" in Bush's languages without nuances) rather than prisoners in a conventional war have not been published for reasons that are easy to understand. According to information circulated by the main US newspapers, the detainees are citizens of 25 countries, including England, France, Australia, Yemen, Algeria, and even Sweden (!). Saudi Arabia alone says "more than 100" of the 158 are Saudi citizens (a figure the Americans see as exaggerated), and Saudi Interior Minister Prince Saud Nayif recently said that his country would like to have them repatriated, to be tried at home.

 As Bush has declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the "Axis of Evil," it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons, be they chemical, biological, or nuclear.

 Even the African observers who endorsed Mugabe's re-election have also criticised the constitutional framework governing elections in Zimbabwe.

 President Bush used his speech to give details about what the September terrorist operations have revealed. It now transpires that we are living in a world threatened by tens of thousands of terrorists and that more are on the way. They are now getting trained in terrorist camps that are scattered in scores of nations. 
----
 Like any form of state terrorism, it is above all contradictory. Yesterday, Yasser Arafat was being asked to police the area he was supposed to be in charge of, while destroying the instruments of his power. Today, he is being completely isolated and the desire to drive him away is scarcely disguised. 
----
 Mugabe must be forced to yield to a new process of constitutional reform leading to a new constitution. There must be mass action for a new constitution. 
----
 This is the first time in war history that "terrorists" have become war prisoners. While the international community does not have any universally acknowledged definition for "terrorist," there is also not any established provision in international law for assessing the punishments for "terrorists." In particular, there is not any precedence to be used as reference.

 Finally, and more significantly, the President enjoys enormous powers under the current constitution which he used to further his electoral chances. It was the President who directed that there be tripartite elections in Harare. And in doing this, he overrode court orders to the contrary.

 Norway is one of the countries in this world that has earned the most from fossil fuels. This gives us a special responsibility in climate policy-not least vis-a-vis the poorest countries.

 It is only natural, with the guerilla operations successively occur, even inside the fortified settlements, that the world begins to wonder whether the accusations that Arafat was planning, and instructing attacks on Israeli targets despite his captivity, and the round-the-clock Israeli surveillance, were founded. The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology.

 Finally, the center is connected with the most promising space programs, which envisage the creation of an completely new family of Angara carrier rockets, the first of which should launch from the Russian Plesetsk space center next year. Incidentally, the money earned by the Khrunichev center has given serious support to the existence of Russia's main space center in recent years. These funds allowed the Plesetsk launch pad, which was built in Soviet times to launch the Ukrainian Zenit carrier rockets, to begin to be re-equipped for the upcoming Angara and as well as the establishment of an entire ground infrastructure for launching light Rokot space carriers, remodeled from SS-19 ballistic combat missiles.

 What holds true with regard to threats by EU leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain European states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing. There have been reports that vital components German factories are supposed to supply to the defense establishment are arriving slowly, as is the case regarding the arrival of vital supplies from other European countries.

 On the other hand, for now, the creditors do not see any signals of concrete support from the G-7.

 For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moreover, the aim of these plans is to make the Palestinians yield to the dictates of the Israeli-US alliance, which seeks a mimic resolution to the Palestinian issue, which will perpetuate the occupation and facilitate the expansion of settlements.

 Norway and the other rich countries have a moral responsibility to achieve real reductions. Regardless of what Norway and other countries manage to do in this respect, we must prepare ourselves for climate changes. According to the United Nations' climate panel, in the next 10 to 20 years changes in the climate will be almost unaffected by what we do in the way of initiatives in the next few years to reduce emissions of climate gases. The explanation is that the increased concentration of climate gases in the atmosphere and the slowness of the climate system will make a certain degree of global warming unavoidable.

 This report [above-mentioned document by China] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective. Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard. The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001--the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States. Pakistan has not only earned a bad name but also its internal and external problems have increased manifold. Pakistan should draw its own conclusions in the light of its own circumstances, from this report issued by China. Instead of blindly accepting every demand made by the United States and responding positively to every American phone call, Pakistan should take every single step carefully.

 After four years of arduous negotiations, the Marrakesh conference ended successfully at 0600 hours last Saturday. Its objective was to complete the regulations governing the Kyoto Protocol and thereby create political and technical conditions for the latter's ratification by the international community. 
----
 What Japan is doing with respect to the issue of putting the "Kyoto Protocol" into force is tantamount to an act of betrayal against mankind in the effort to protect human lives, health, and the earth's atmosphere. 
----
 The third big challenge concerns land use: a change in the way land and forests are used so as to prevent the inclusion of activities that do not lead to a real reduction in emissions. An example of this is the simple presence or aging of forests. The controversy over that subject contributed to the deadlock at the conference in The Hague last year, since the pressure to include such activities was very strong in view of their zero cost. 
----
Norway should be in the forefront of combating climate problems. The government wants to play an active role internationally but we should also work on reducing emissions here at home. 
----
 The US has repeatedly suggested the possibility of its taking military action against the government of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. It is possible that if the US military attack Iraq, Japan, which has shown understanding of the axis of evil remark, will be asked to provide active support to the US as it did during US attacks on Afghanistan.

 But due to the strong initiative of the global community, led by the European Union, countries agreed on a set of rules to implement the climate change treaty _ with or without the U.S.

 In essence, it seems that they all agreed on one thing: meeting a commitment is inviolable. This position is surprising all the same because the history of the IMF is lined with derogations. We have stopped counting the number of times financial bailout plans have been set up to help this or that government in difficulty. We also stopped counting the unconditional support the institution has given some heads of state, who are neither especially virtuous nor especially democratic, because it was in the political, commercial and economic interest of the United States to do so.

Harare, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Despite the shortcomings of incumbent President Robert Mugabe's rule which has seen Zimbabwe's economic decline in recent years, the 78-year-old leader has carried off the palm in the country's closest-fought presidential election since independence 22 years ago.

 Now the United States has issued an assassination order against millions of human beings without having any proof, reason or documentation. The only reason for this would be opposition to the United States. It would therefore be appropriate for all Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the United States. If the European countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from Iran, blaming Iran for violating human rights, then they should recall their ambassadors from the United States. After all the United States is not violating the rights of one human being, but many many human beings.

 Western nations and US allies, for the first time ever, took such a concerted stance critical of Washington. In the past, it was their attitude trying to read Washington's mind and doing nothing that would incur its displeasure. This time, however, they spoke out against it and attacked without hesitation. Inside the United States itself, too, there were widespread debates against the Bush gaffe. 
----
 The protocol faced danger of being shelved altogether, when the U.S, which is responsible for one-fourth of all CO2 emissions in the world, decided to abruptly withdraw from the climate change treaty last March. The Bush administration fears the treaty will have a negative effect on its economy and maintains that developing countries, such as China and India, should also be subject to mandatory emission targets. 
----
 Despite these negative reports, most observer groups have declared the election free and fair.

 However, Bush is greatly miscalculating. Just like those who enjoy fire are bound to die by being burnt, the only thing that will be left to war maniacs like Bush, who tries to find a way out of a crisis through aggression and war, is a bitter destruction.

 Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants.

 These are not abstract questions. Countries sign on to the Geneva Convention not to be altruistic but to ensure that their own soldiers will be well treated if captured. The assumption is that what we do to them will be done to us. Let us hope that, in this instance, the terrible equation does not hold.

 We do hope so, against all hope.

 Some were surprised by President Bush's repeated reference to Iran as among the countries that make the "access of evil." This is because following the September operations there were some hints suggesting that Washington was viewing Iran from a new angle.

 However, the State Department gives the Saudi government its due, recalling Crown Prince Abdallah's peacemaking initiative, proposing that the Arab world recognize Tel-Aviv in exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Palestinian lands. Possibly, in the eyes of the report's authors, such a step on the part of Riyadh excuses it to a certain extent for its other transgressions.

 Despite the Parliament's recommendation, the chances that the association agreements will be suspended are very slim. It takes more than a recommendation from the European Parliament for this to happen; the decision has to be taken by both the European Commission and the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous.

 Since Japan has no spirit of independence and has always acted on US directions, Japan had continued to put off Diet ratification of the protocol and took such an attitude at the UN session held this time, under the plausible pretext that it would be meaningless to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force, if the United States were excluded.

US envoy retired General Anthony Zinni is to arrive in the region under circumstances similar to those that surrounded his first visit to Palestine and Israel. The Israeli Government works to abort his mission in advance by storming Palestinian territories, assassinating citizens it alleges have links to security activities, and arresting innocent citizens. The only change is that the Israeli authorities have denied any link between a number of Palestinian martyrs and prisoners on one hand and the armed organizations on the other, saying they were mere unarmed citizens, who were accidentally present near regular Israeli targets.

 Their number will rise to at least 1,000 over the next three months. The government has 30 million dollars ready to build in Guantanamo ('Gitmo' to generations and generations of Marines) nine top-security prisons just for them: But up until then it will keep them in the cages. "We could keep some of them for an undetermined period, they are dangerous individuals," announced Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Without a trial, without an attorney. Because they are prisoners, admittedly, but in the view of the Americans they do not have the status of prisoners of war, and the Geneva Convention is not valid for them: "They are unlawful combatants, and we are not running a recreational center. I do not have the slightest concern over their treatment. In any case, they are better off than they were when we caught them," added the Minister. But the photos of 'Gitmo' are now in danger of removing the United States from the niche of affection and solidarity which September 11 had guaranteed it in the hearts of many people.

 The outflows forced some banks to ask the government to set limits. Cavallo could think of nothing better than the curbs on withdrawals. According to former Minister Roque Fernandez, it was "the worst mistake in the history of the Argentine economy," while influential businessman Arnaldo Musich (FIEL [Latin American Economic Research Foundation]-Techint) considered it an "inexcusable" mistake.

 Hence you can hardly speak of a "targeting error" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft. Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes.

 These facts are well understood by the US Administration as human rights violations take place every day. The United States has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home. World analysts remarked that the US evaluation of the practice of human rights in other countries depends on the level of political relations between the United States and those countries.

Seeing in believing, and the longer you live the more you see. It was written, the episode was broadcast live, and there was no way that those words from the president of the Republic were adulterated, deformed, or falsified by the hidden agents of the media conspiracy. No. He asserted, in these exact words, this barbarism: "4 February is not just any date, it is a historic date we can well compare to 19 April 1810, when that civic-military rebellion also opened a new path towards national independence."

 It is high time for the United States to hurry to offer its assistance. The ingredients for a decision are in large measure in place if they would only be admitted by the two sides. They are the simultaneous ending of the violence and the [Israeli] resettlement policy followed by negotiations on the basis of the recent Saudi Arabian proposal and the earlier results of the talks at Camp David and Taba.

 "This is the minimum that has to be done. Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming," comments one high-ranking member of the Brazilian Government. Alone, and under the command of a president who managed to create a strong political coalition explained only by his own survival instinct, Argentines will be unable to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability. How does this affect Brazil? To answer a question of this nature, the Brazilian Foreign Minister would surely resort to Ortega y Gasset: "I am I and my circumstances. If I do not save them, I do not save myself."

 The European initiative will serve as a test of not only Israel's intentions toward the peace process that are known for being negative, but also as a test of the US stand. This initiative will show whether the United States will give up its complete and blind bias toward Israel in order to achieve a just solution restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and guaranteeing peace, security, and stability for all nations in the region.

 Israel's attack on Arafat's headquarters deals a stinging slap on the face of ongoing Arab efforts to negotiate a political settlement to the ongoing conflict. The just-concluded Arab summit had unanimously adopted a Saudi peace initiative, which called for full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory occupied in the 1967 war, the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and a "fair solution" to the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN resolutions. In return, the Arabs had agreed to consider that the Arab-Israeli conflict is at an end, enter into peace treaties with Israel and open normal relations in the context of this comprehensive peace. Israel's immediate response to the peace plan was to dismiss it as a non-starter. The attack on the PA headquarters barely a day after the peace initiative was accepted by the Arabs clearly indicates Israel's rejection of any efforts to negotiate peace through compromise. It has been clear for some time that the Sharon government is planning on settling issues with the Palestinians through invasion and re-occupation of Palestinian land and then offering a settlement based on its terms. As events over the past two years indicate, a strategy based on imposing a settlement through military means will only deepen anger and provoke retaliatory violence from the Palestinians. The attack on the PA headquarters is an explosive move and has put West Asia on the brink of another war. The international community must act immediately to pressure the Israeli government to step back from the dangerous course of action it is determined to pursue.	
----
 To add a country like Argentina to this list of problems is to allow the growth of a dangerous focus of social dissatisfaction, which is tending to express itself outside of any institutional control. Argentine society is divorcing itself from political parties and national institutions, and it is in such an environment that radical responses germinate, such as authoritarian regimes and the formation of guerrilla groups.

 Of course the second side in the US axis is Israel, and definitely the third side will go to no one but Britain, as it conforms to the same criteria and because it completely supports the US stance and considers it the absolute right in all cases. The countries of the US axis are similar, for they cooperate, are joined by a strategic bond, and each defends the other and supports it with words and deeds. We can review, for example, the voting results in the Security Council to see how Washington always defends Israel, then how Britain always justifies the stances by both countries in admirable harmony.

 Perhaps the most important characteristic of the new European initiative is the fact that it annuls the hardline Israeli-US stand, which rejects any kind of political negotiations unless the violence stops completely.

 The tragic and shocking events that shook the United States, destroying a number of its economic, urban, and military landmarks, have aroused grief and sorrow worldwide. This is because the terrorist violence has struck innocent women and children and defenseless civilians. The scenes of destruction reminded the Palestinian people of the ongoing devastation and the Palestinians who are falling victim to the Israeli acts of bombardment, targeted assassinations, and incursions into Palestinian towns and villages, including Bayt Jala, Gaza, Khan Yunus, Rafah, Janin, Tulkarm, Ramlallah, Jericho, Nabulus, and others.

However, there are a few ambiguous points, such as:

 Justice always finds support and sympathy. In contrast, injustice cannot escape denunciation and rejection. An overview of international developments in February, among other things, clearly points to this fact.

 Soon after the World Trade Centre attacks, we started to witness the beginning of a concerted effort by the Bush administration and the media to cast Arabs and Muslims as the new enemy of America. The campaign has been successful so far, and has not been seriously challenged by Arab and Muslim Americans who have been struggling to merely distance themselves from terrorism. The early signs of the newly-shaped American perception of their conflict with Arabs and Muslims have started to surface. Complete disregard for the plight of the Palestinians despite timid warnings to Israel to show restraint is indicative of the new political perspective. 
----
 It is very important for the United States to realize the difference between the US and Israeli cases. The Palestinians want nothing from Washington but to understand their cause and stand beside right and justice. What is required of Israel is to withdraw, both on the military and settlement fronts, from the territories occupied in 1967, and the United States should push its ally Israel in that direction. This would put an end to sensitivities, hatred, and injustice and spread peace in the region and the world.

 The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies. The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts. Incidentally, the riots also occurred following the IMF's announcement of Argentina's debts.

 It would have perhaps been logical and acceptable if Washington had demanded a mutual and concurrent cessation of the ongoing violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and called on Israel not to exploit the calm to open the files of security revenge through assassinations and arrests. It would have been logical and acceptable if Washington had asked Israel to announce its commitment to the principle of withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 and to end the settlement activity. Such demands constitute the strong base for bringing about calm and stability, putting a final end to violence and terrorism, and turning a new leaf toward fruitful negotiations leading to a just peace acceptable by all sides. 
----
For its own reasons, which are linked to its interests and, naturally, to Israel's interests, the United States chose to put intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority. It wanted the PA to meet difficult, even impossible, security conditions. It also tried, through this pressure, to remove the legitimacy of the PA and its chairman Yasir Arafat under the pretext of terrorism or support for terrorism. This US position, which is fully biased to Israel, strengthened Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's attempts to suppress national Palestinian ambitions and achieve his declared objective of establishing Israeli security on the rubble of the legitimate Palestinian rights. 
----
The U.S. government says that the terrorist attack on New York City was an act of war. Yet it refuses to treat those it has captured in the course of this war as prisoners of war. Instead, it refers to them as "unlawful combatants" not entitled to the protection of the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the U.S. signed and which sets out rules for treating enemy soldiers. It shackles them, houses them in unprotected chain link compounds (in Cuba, of all places) and threatens "intense interrogation." 
----
 The conclusion to be reached from this whole picture is that under the current constitutional and legal framework for the holding of presidential elections, it is almost impossible to vote out an incumbent President. It was naive for the Movement for Democratic Change to believe that the people's anger against Mugabe was, in itself, sufficient to carry the day in an election, whatever the circumstances. 
----
 It is to be noted that over the past five days, the Palestinian side demonstrated clear self-restraint and abidance to the cease-fire despite Israel's provocations and the bloodbaths that the Israeli army committed against the Palestinians during this period. So far, Israel's provocations have led to the slaughter of more than 50 Palestinian males and females and injured scores of others. Moreover, the attacks are continuing on the Israeli military checkpoints even against vehicles transporting pregnant women in labor and against unarmed citizens trying to cross these checkpoints that have been erected between the beleaguered Palestinian towns and villages that are surrounded to the point of strangulation.

 So how does such a computer work? Let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a "B" DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even. The DNA section -- the "input" -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's "hardware". Other DNA sections are added, which act as "software".

Washington -- If this is a man... Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld calls the treatment of the prisoners captured in Afghanistan and shut away in the US base at Guantanamo Bay on the island of Cuba, "humane." But the concentration camp strongly resembles a dog pound, and no one would want his dog to be treated like that.

 The ill effects of the Argentine crisis can contaminate the nearest countries first, like Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. And there is no guarantee that a political destabilization of the region would bypass even Chile, where memories of the military dictatorship are still very strong. One cannot ignore the fact that, only 20 years ago, all these countries - including Brazil and Peru - were ruled by generals.

 Certainly, Mr. Stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, Franz Josef Strauss. Rather than force himself on the CDU, he waited to be called. Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well. The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort. The CDU chose him because it believes in victory. The government is floundering, more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago. The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign. If anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is Mr. Stoiber.

 The prisoners emerge from their cages only to take a shower, to go for a medical, or to take their short daily walk.

 As can be seen from the aforementioned, there is no real evidence either to link our Republic to terrorism or to designate as an evil country. The real ringleader of evil and the base of evil is the United States. Manifest examples are the following facts. Over the recent 10 years alone, the US imperialists perpetrated open [word indistinct] state-level terrorism against sovereign states, such as Iraq and Yugoslavia, with preposterous reasons and pretexts. They are posing a grave threat to the world's peace and security, blabbing about the establishment of an invasive missile defense system.

 A total disengagement from the Palestinians, complete with walls and razor wire, might provide Israel its long-desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians, any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation. But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians. By now, it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding.

 The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East. Maybe Joschka Fischer's plan for suspending Germany's military aid for Israel, that is, possible EU economic sanctions against Tel Aviv is honorable, but it is a late and disturbingly long-term plan. Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, and the Palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state.

 At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States "did not show the slightest sympathy," still less "the least regret," for the breaking-off of Venezuela's democratic system. Both the White House and the US State Department expressed "satisfaction" over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one "wept over him." Besides, they also claimed that Chavez "had only himself to blame" for the coup.

 Practically speaking, a buffer zone will be near impossible to erect. A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements. Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement. He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible.

 At present, very few in the international community have responded in favor of the theory of "evil axis," because many countries, including China, have made clear their stand against willful expansion of the war against terror. The other day, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov said: "It is unacceptable to Russia to mechanically extend the scope of antiterrorist action to any country, including Iraq." Furthermore, the Russian side has stressed time and time again that the United States' accusations against Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK should be settled within the UN framework and raised objections to any hostile action against these three countries without authorization from the Security Council. In fact, even the US ally, Britain, and other Western countries have indicated that the antiterrorist military action should be conducted with restraint, for otherwise the danger of losing control will emerge. It seems that the market for the theory of "evil axis" is still limited.

 During World War II, the axis countries were very strong and bound by an alliance. The new axis, however, represents small developing countries that are not linked by any alliance or cooperation.

 It is a fact that Palestinians are becoming more militant and that the nature of their resistance to occupation is changing dramatically. But it is not war by any military definition. In the past 18 months more than 1200 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and mostly in their homes, camps, offices, schools, and factories -- not on the battlefield. Many thousands were maimed and injured, hundreds of homes demolished and thousands of hectares of farmland destroyed. If these statistics amount to anything, they point to the continuing waste of human life and property that millions of Palestinians under occupation endure on a daily basis.

Caracas (AFP) -- The Venezuelan Military High Command maintains its support for President Hugo Chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared Wednesday night [10 April], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops. Analyst Luis Vicente Leon, head of the influential polling firm Datanalisis, told AFP on Wednesday that the "president continues to control power," and that "the military sector, despite the emergence of another dissident general, shows no sign of contravening the president's authority: Chavez still controls the troop posts."

From the vantage point of Latin America and the Caribbean, there can be no doubt about the United States' complicity with the military and civilian authors of the abortive coup d'etat against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. From Mexico to Buenos Aires, television viewers saw, on the Spanish CNN and Telemundo channels, the undisguised pleasure displayed by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the announcement of Hugo Chavez's "resignation," which he never in fact signed. Far from condemning that which the United States at no time described as a coup d'etat, President Bush's spokesman explained that Chavez had indeed brought it on himself and that he bore the responsibility for the "confused events," having violated human rights.

 After the 11 September attacks on the United States, the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people. Supported by the world, the United States launched the "war against terrorism" of this century. Bush stressed that the war is not only the "US war" but also a "world war." The United States views itself as a "major force of anti-terrorism," for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. Bush said, "Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists" and "any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime." The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it. It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism. But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan. Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it. Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner, it is anybody's guess.

 In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies. Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development. In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite. This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan. This program not only puts Japan in the lead in providing new mobile communication services in the Asia-Pacific region, but also allows Japan to test some new satellite communication techniques to be introduced worldwide. A Japanese made H2A rocket will launch this satellite in 2002.

 Put simply, what we are seeing is the naked pursuit of US interests. No one who has ever studied realist political science will find this surprising. To earn legitimacy, however, US interests must be made to appear just. Even though almost all military mobilizations in history have been motivated by notions of good versus evil or of orthodoxy versus unorthodoxy, efforts to present the naked pursuit of US interests as a battle of good versus evil reflect a lack of understanding and tolerance. Demonizing the enemy will guarantee that peace will not be gained through war.

The arrogance that marked the latest Manichaean pronouncement of the US President, George W. Bush, alleging an "axis of evil" on the international stage has justifiably produced a backlash of adverse reactions. In his State of the Union address to the US lawmakers on January 29, Mr. Bush categorically identified Iran, as also Iraq and North Korea, besides their "terrorist allies" as a functional anti-US entity and as a collective "axis of evil" in the global arena. By raising this new political bogey in the specific context of the present US-led international "campaign" against terrorism and by aggressively harping on such ideas at a Republican caucus on February 1, Mr. Bush has left little or no room for doubt about his real foreign policy intentions. The defining characteristic of the presumptive "axis of evil" is portrayed as a tendency on the part of its constituent states and non-state players to acquire weapons of mass destruction [WMDs]. What is more, Mr. Bush has already begun articulating a policy designed to "prevent" such "outlaw regimes" and their "terrorist" cohorts from "threatening America" and its "friends and allies". It is in this climate of an impassioned American campaign against new phobias that some powers like China have joined the chorus of protest by the three countries named by Mr. Bush.

 Appeals were already made to the creditors during the first phase of the debt rescheduling involving the $55 billion held by Argentine funds and that was completed at the end of November. And they will come under pressure again: The IMF's recent refusal to approve a $1.3 billion loan is designed specifically to help Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo put pressure on private investors, as the latter have clearly understood even if not always the observers. At the same time private debtors who became indebted in a strong currency would find themselves ruined by a peso devaluation. This is why dollarization has generated such support among politicians: From former President Carlos Menem, today leader of the most influential Peronist faction, to new Finance Secretary Miguel Kiguel, a former banker, charged along with Domingo Cavallo with restoring order to public finances.

 That being the case, why has the only superpower in today's world insisted that they are the new "axis of evil?" According to President Bush, all these three countries "sponsor terrorism" and attempt to "develop weapons of mass destruction." But so far, there has been no conclusive evidence indicating that the government of any of them was involved in the "11 September" incident of terrorist attacks that happened in the United States last year. Moreover, Iran made a clear stand in support of the war against terror after the incident. As to whether or not they have developed weapons of mass destruction, all three countries have denied it, but the United States does not believe them. However, even if they did have this kind of weapons, who would dare to use them against the United States, the world's number one nuclear nation, either directly or indirectly through terrorists, while risking the danger of being completely annihilated? Actually, these three countries do have one common denominator, i.e., that their values and polices do not agree with those of the United States and none of them are on good terms with the United States. That is why many people suspect the purpose of the United States' putting Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK in the box of "evil axis" is to prepare public opinion for possible strikes against these old foes under the banner of fighting terror.

-neutral country. At the micro-level, though, the US President has obviously counted on his country's several different disputes with Iran, Iraq and North Korea over time. As for Teheran specifically, its defiant view of America's expanding strategic-military presence in Iran's neighborhood at this juncture may have weighed with Mr. Bush. In the event, the dynamics of an emerging Iran-US tussle will determine his actions against the "axis". Clearly at this point there is no cause for the international community to support American efforts to widen the campaign beyond Afghanistan.

On their knees during an inspection, and chained up in their orange overalls. With small blue masks over their mouths, ear muffs on their ears, and goggles covered up with sticky tape. Opposite the cages, those cages of theirs not even two meters by three meters -- which seen together look like a chicken farm run by a sadist -- built from wooden beams and sheets of metal, cement, and barbed wire, exposed to the rain and the wind of the Tropics. Their beards shaven off: for hygiene, say the camp's military commanders; to humiliate them in their religion, reply human rights defenders half the world over. That world which had looked in tears at the photos and the pictures of September 11, the Towers collapsing, and the infamy against civilization, and which is now discovering these other photos, the first ones to come out of Camp X-Ray, the open-air prison which the United States has set up at Guantanamo base, their historic outpost on the island of Cuba. One hundred and forty-four is the number, so far, of prisoners captured in the 100 days of the Afghanistan war, and taken here from Kandahar air base on a 27-hour flight, blindfolded, gagged, tied up, and dosed up with sedatives on the C17 cargo planes belonging to the Stars and Stripes air force. They are Taliban, and perhaps members of al-Qa'ida, but nobody can say so with certainty because their names are not known, and there are no formal charges. 
----
 So if Sept. 11 was an act of war, why are those captured in the aftermath not treated as prisoners of war? It is considered legitimate self-defence for the U.S. and its allies to invade Afghanistan. Why is it not considered equally legitimate for the Afghans and their allies to resist this invasion?

 The above-mentioned statement by China is the first ever by an important country after the 11 September events in the United States. In the document, the United States has been very openly told that it has become the number one country in damaging solidarity of other countries and violating human rights there. The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, on the start of his visit to Austria, protested against this dictatorial move by the United States. He also condemned the statement made by President Bush terming Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and that these countries are preparing weapons of mass destruction.

 The question now is: Did the White House lie? If it turns out to be true that the two US colonels were involved in the failed attempt, there can be no other conclusion. The two colonels would not have been acting on their own. They must have been under orders -- orders stretching all the way back to the Oval Office. This spells serious trouble for Bush. The whiff of scandal and conspiracy is in the air -- and the American media, ever addicted to conspiracy theories, is not going to let it go. It -- and the opposition Democrats, still smarting at his election victory -- will dig for dirt as long it takes. Even if it finally turns out that the two colonels were operating without the knowledge and approval of the White House, it will be a disaster for Bush. Americans will want to know who exactly is running their country.

 Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants. Thus the benchmark covenants could be reconciled with the European Commission's recent proposals for launching a unified market for European carbon dioxide emissions by 2005. This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants. However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights. Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling. However, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights.

 It is true that the Palestinian towns are now under occupation, that the Palestinian Authority's institutions have been destroyed, and that Arafat is still besieged at his office as a hostage. It is also true that thousands of Palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire Palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives. All this is one thing, but the Palestinian people's will is something different.

 Amidst the heat of military battles in Afghanistan, and on the background of the double crime that hit the United States, international opinion is now willing to overlook some inhumane practices that were made on this or that front. However, the situation has changed fundamentally since the batches of Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners started arriving one after the other to Guatanamo base shackled and caged in cages that are no longer than eight feet and wider than six. The attention of the world moved from Afghanistan to Cuba to follow what Amnesty International considers an "uncomfortable situation" for the detainees. This has prompted two of Washington's closest allies, Britain and Australia, to express their "concern" over the way the prisoners were transported from Afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity. 
----
 As seen in the above, the world's public sentiment stands on the side of justice. The denunciation and rejection of injustice and the support and encouragement to justice, evident in the February international developments, do reflect change in the 21st-century international relations in which imperialists are weakening and aspirations to independence are strengthening. The general situation in the new century is making turns in favor of the independent developments of progressive nations including our country.

 With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice. This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark. And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday. Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit. 
----
 In other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically. Newspaper headlines such as "United Nations Confirms US Bombing of Village and Mosque" and "100 Killed in Bombing in Eastern Afghanistan" speak for themselves. According to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-Qa'ida troops nor Taliban had been observed. Even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy.

 The Climate Change Convention of 1992, to which the US is a Party, requires industrialised countries to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. Achieving this would only be a first step towards stabilising global greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous climate change. This is the ultimate objective of the Convention to which the US has subscribed. However, the new plan does not lead to such a stabilisation, but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels.

Following the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer. Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy. After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush's main foreign policy line. Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration's diplomacy.

 The Americans are issuing denials, saying "There is no inhumane treatment, and we are open, as far as possible, to the suggestions of the Red Cross." As for the rest, they are raising the objection of reason of State, and an emergency which is definitely not over: Since September 11, 1,500 suspected terrorists have been captured in 50 countries, but the intelligence services claim that at least 10,000 affiliates of al-Qa'ida are still scattered across the world, "their network all around us." The inmates at 'Gitmo' must confess, and serve as a warning to their comrades who are still free: This is the unpleasant truth. The status of prisoners of war (which, by law, ought not to be decided on by Rumsfeld, but by a tribunal) would protect them from interrogation, and would guarantee that they get a trial, by court martial, that was much fairer than that of the secret special tribunals which Bush is trying to set up. "Our system will in any event be much fairer than that of the!

 Sharon is a master of escalation. He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis.

 The report is generally quite frank and its wording strong, but it proposes no corrective action. Consolidating the anti-terrorist alliance and expanding the war against terror are overshadowing concerns about human rights. In exchange for support for its war on terror, the US is tacitly agreeing to ignore abuses by other members of the anti-terror coalition. The most glaring examples are Russia's suppression of resis-tance to its rule in Chechnya, China's suppression of independence advocates in Xinjiang and the Falun Gong movement, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. US activities, meanwhile, show no sign of promoting the universal values of democracy, human rights and peace.

He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance.

 Among the unfounded allegations was the claim that the Islamic Republic enjoys no social base and is an unpopular system because of its human rights violations. However, the massive participation of millions of Iranians in the grand rallies on Feb. 11 to mark the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution and defy U.S. threats against this country once again revealed the emptiness of U.S. charges against Iran. It is quite clear that such baseless accusations are only made to tarnish the image of Iran, since it follows an independent policy and refuses to bow to U.S. domination.

 For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism.

 However, the fact that certain countries have a more balanced view of the conflict is not the only reason to doubt that anti-Israeli decisions will, in fact, be adopted.

Israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the European states eliminate customs breaks afforded to Israeli exports. If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena -- in a direction that many in Israel would support wholeheartedly -- they will not be able to promote their positions in such a manner.

 In any event, it is more than apparent that the United States intends to play a conspicuous role and exert increasing pressure as far as the oil issue is concerned. It seems that by wielding its authority and exercising dictatorial powers as the world's only superpower, the United States is determined to play a front and centre role in the intricate international game of oil prices and the free flow of this all-important strategic product otherwise known as the "Black Gold". The fall of Hugo Chavez in Caracas is a crystal-clear message and warning by the US to anyone in the world who is contemplating to use oil as a political tool in the future.

 In reality, the United States is truly a country that has no qualifications and face to take issue with other countries by saying that they are an evil and so on. Nevertheless, Bush is impertinently picking a quarrel regarding our Republic by saying this and that and viciously spoke ill of the DPRK. This is truly a very despicable act.

 Those in attendance did not argue. On the contrary, they found solidarity in the view that it is impossible to explain everything with models.

 Moreover, the Taliban and "al-Qaeda" members came from many countries in the world and the "POW" issue involves the laws and dignity of many countries. What worries the West and some other countries most is that, if the United States refuses to treat these detainees as POWs, then their soldiers may be treated the same way as the Guantanamo prisoners should they be captured by the Taliban remnants and other radical organizations when they take part in the United Nations' peace-keeping missions.

 The promotion of "gradual Taiwan independence" by the leader of the Taiwanese authorities is from his misjudgment of two situations: the internal situation and the external situation. Internally, he considers the "legislative" election last year as the public's recognition to his idea of "Taiwan independence." Support from Lee Teng-hui and overseas "Taiwan independence" forces makes him believe that "the situation is great." In fact, the economic difficulties in the island, the political deadlock, and the public's confidence crisis should be the agenda for the Taiwanese authorities' top concern. Irresponsible promotion of "Taiwan independence" and intensification of cross-strait ties are definitely not blessings to Taiwan. Externally, Sino-US relations are increasingly improving. President Bush will visit China soon. The United States has made a commitment that it will not change its Taiwan policy. But the Taiwanese authorities exaggerated Sino-US conflicts and placed hopes on seeking benefits from such conflicts. This is really an unwise idea.

 If any people are going to be moved by the scenes of destruction that involved Manhattan, the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon, it is the Palestinian people.

 Whatever the case, we are entering a difficult period. There is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its "trump card" and commit further acts of terrorism. The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most. The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage. But we had no choice. To have sat back with arms folded would have made us all hostages.

 An accord with the governors would be a clear sign that public spending was going to be brought under control where it is most out of control.

 By some ironical trick of history, it was on 11 September 2001 that the OAS member countries, with the United States represented by Secretary of State Colin Powell, signed a new "democratic charter" envisaging regional defense mechanisms for the constitutional regimes. But the attacks that hit the United States that same day initiated a new era, relegating the defense of democratic principles to a subordinate place behind the priority objective of combating terrorism. In the new Manichean world, divided between friends and enemies of the sole superpower, Hugo Chavez was unwise enough to condemn the American bombing raids in Afghanistan. His visits to Iraq's Saddam Husayn and Libya's Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, his friendship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, his relations with the Colombian guerrillas, his speeches against "neo-liberal globalization," and his commitment to a multipolar world already placed him in the Evil camp, even though the Bolivarian Venezuela has never ceased to guarantee oil supplies to United States, of which it is one of the three foremost suppliers.

 This being the case, it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities. Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation, ending settlement construction activities, and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. 
----
 For a comprehensive fair settlement on the issue, it is required, first of all, that the Palestinians are guaranteed the right to self-determination, that the founding of an independent Palestinian state is realized, and the Israeli aggressors withdraw from all the Arab land they occupy illegally, including Golan Heights.

 As for the recent event in which Jose Bustani, director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], was voted out of office at the organization's special plenary session, there clearly existed an "American background." This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani. It has been reported that the United States had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries, promising to pay for their long due OPCW membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the United States.

The hero of the Gulf War, Colin Powell, did not exactly cover himself in glory in his diplomatic mission to the Middle East as the US president's envoy. His task was to create "a peaceful environment" in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine. 
----
 But the truth of the matter is that Israel and the Palestinians are not at war. Palestine is not an independent state with an army that may soon, if unchecked, march into the streets of Tel Aviv or overrun Jerusalem. Israel already occupies the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has done so since June 1967, when Israel and neighboring Arab states fought a six-day war. In October 1973 Israel fought a real war on two fronts, one against Syria and the other against Egypt. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon and its troops reached Beirut in a one-sided war that was aimed at destroying the PLO and burying Palestinian claims to their land for good.

 Just as President Bush himself has called for "peaceful resolution in connection with actions to be taken against the "Axis of Evil," the United States is viewed as organizing a global encirclement to achieve a diplomatic victory. However, such a scenario can be assured success only if it is underpinned by President Bush's "policy of not excluding a variety of options" inclusive of military action.

 The first-day menu for the prisoners shows that they had a package of vacuum-packed Italian vegetable noodle and a package containing peanuts, granola bars, and a box of colorful, sugar-coated cereal, a favorite of American young people. The menu also includes oatmeal, raisin, potato chips and a pretzel. While these foods are strange to the prisoners, the United States has indeed abided by the dietary rules that Muslims have to follow. Of course, there is clean water for the prisoners to drink.

Tehran, April 13, IRNA -- Police in Iran have recently seized 824 kilos of illegal drugs, mostly opium, during a series of operations in which three smugglers were killed and 18 others injured, police officials said Saturday. The biggest seizure, amounting to 697 kilos, was made in the city of Iranshahr in the Sistan Baluchestan province, where four fire arms were also confiscated. The rest of the hauls were made in the provinces of southern Fars and southeastern Khorasan. Meanwhile, a police head said Saturday that some 877 kilos of narcotics had been seized in the south of the Tehran province in the last Iranian year which ended on March 20, 2001. The bulk of the seizures was opium, weighing 534 kilos, besides 118 kilos of hashish plus other drug assortments. Police dismantled 72 gangs of drug traffickers in the period and arrested 12,910 people on drug-related offenses. An official in the southeastern city of Kerman said Saturday that police in the Kerman province had seized 100 kilos of morphine from drug traffickers in recent days. Iran accounts for 80 percent of the opium and 90 percent of the morphine intercepted in the world, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. The Islamic Republic has launched a relentless anti-drug campaign since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, in which more than 3,100 policemen have lost their lives. Iran's anti-drug campaign costs the country 800 million dollars per year, according to officials. An official said recently that the Iranian police had seized 112 tons of illegal drugs and arrested 306,000 people on drug-related charges during last Iranian year which ended on March 21, 2001.

 There also seems to be a difference among the foreigners: In all likelihood, captured British fighters will be sent to Britain after questioning.

What is there about a coup against the constitutional order that could resemble the most important day in Venezuelan history? In what way can Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez be seen as comparable to Jose Felix Ribas, Francisco Salias, the philosopher Juan German Roscio, or Canon Jose Cortes de Madariaga?

 The United Nations human rights rapporteur, Maurice Copithorne, on Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran. Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic. The UN rapporteur's new report on Iran, which he submitted to the commission on Friday, includes nothing new. In most cases he described the legal punishments like floggings and executions of murderers and major drug traffickers that are applied based on the Shria, or Islamic law as human rights violations. In other cases, he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities. He made such charges despite the fact that women's political, social and cultural participation is not less than that of men. Women in Iran hold managerial, academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet. And as far as minorities are concerned, they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority, as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely. In his report, the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran's internal affairs. For instance, he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran, while the measure has been taken in line with the law. He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations! This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials. Interestingly, although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996, he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic. This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime. Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

 The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected.

 For the rest of the world, however, the story already confirms the suspicions that the Bush administration is hell-bent on eliminating its enemies by whatever means possible, legal or illegal. The involvement of US military personnel in the putsch suggests a return to the old days when the CIA would organize coups and assassinations to further US interests. The record is long and to Washington's eternal discredit: the CIA's attempts to kill Fidel Castro, its involvement in the coups in Guatemala in 1954 and in Chile in 1973. President Clinton had, it was thought, closed the book on such nefarious activities. Apparently not. The Clinton era turns out to have been merely an interlude.

 This allegation contradicts the simplest fact on the ground, as Israel is the one that occupies most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel is the one that possesses vast military power which it uses to make incursions into and raid Palestinian cities and refugee camps; to intimidate women and children; to assassinate innocent activists and citizens; to destroy buildings, facilities, infrastructure, roads, water pipes, and electricity and telephone poles; to attack Palestinian ambulances and kill medical teams; and to carry out other retaliatory, suppressive, and devastating practices.

 Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned.

In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage.

 In its approach to the national Palestinian rights the Israeli Government is playing the cat and mouse game. It is trying to use the time factor to perpetuate the occupation.

The cycle of reoccupation-withdrawal-reoccupation is part of this approach, which is no secret to anyone.

 It would be entirely improper if, in its defense of Israel, the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries, such as, Syria and Lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the Hezbolah. It is worrying that among Powell's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front. In some circles, these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel-Palestine problem with a bigger one. For example, a new Israeli-Arab war.

Beijing, 3 Feb (Xinhua)-- In his recent State of the Union address, US President Bush quite unexpectedly labeled Iran, Iraq, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] as an "axis of evil." That statement immediately caused extensive controversy.

Does an "axis of evil" really exist in today's world? The answer should be negative.

 The Kyoto Protocol expresses the world's political will and is becoming the dominant norm in that field from the standpoint of international public law.

That will facilitate their possible convergence later with the international system.

 Contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of Sharon and Bush, this Zionist-US crime has confirmed that the Zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that "the Arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist" is now more distant than before despite some official Arab "recognitions." Millions of Arabs, Palestinians and non-Palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve "coexistence" with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity.

1 What kind of victory is it that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon thinks he is achieving with his "total war"? After occupying the autonomous Palestinian city of Ramallah, Israeli tanks are pushing further into the Palestinian autonomous areas, occupying other cities and destroying the established -- EU-supported -- infrastructure.

 Construction activities carried out in settlements during the period totaled 49. In addition, 102 mobile caravans were added to settlements and new settlement sites and more than 705 donums were added to existing settlements. The report also noted that work on bypass roads continued at a rate faster than that of the government of Barak who gave free rein to settlement activities. Sharon's government has embarked on building 10 bypass roads, some of which were approved by the previous government. The report estimated that building these roads threatens the bulldozing and destruction of more than 31,730 donums.

 True, the sun-screening space umbrella (the author's name) does not have much chance of opening up, due to "political-economic circumstances." Indeed, the idea has not yet captivated the masses so much that they would remove their last trousers to start investing immediately in the project. But the expert urged everyone to despair, "since control of global warming without Russia is impossible; the country is becoming the owner of the controlling block of shares." In Mr. Gudkov's view, everything is developing well, we can take our time, and we can do nothing at all, since global warming is a threat only to the southern countries.

 In February, the European Union [EU] stepped up its moves to bluntly criticize and oppose the "axis of evil" rhetoric. A spokesman of the EU Commission, at a press conference, expressed concerns over the Bush gaffe labeling [North] Korea, Iran, and Iraq as the "axis of evil" and said that "the EU's high representatives do not agree to such policy." The French foreign minister demanded that the United States abandon its one-sidedness, saying that global problems cannot be solved by Washington's arbitrary decision. The UK foreign minister said that, although the UK has been acting as a close ally of the United States since the "11 September incident," it "can no longer stand shoulder to shoulder" with it. One can imagine the extent of such EU sentiment from the descriptions of Bush in French newspapers, such as one depicting him as the modern, 21st-century version of "The Stars and Stripes." Also, there was a cartoon showing him in so ferocious an image wearing a T-shirt and jogging pants bearing some English letters, baring his teeth and with a glare of hatred in his eyes. Representatives of more than 40 political parties of 25 European countries even sent letters of protest to Bush.

 This behaviour further confirms what has long been very clear; the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is more interested in pursuing its expansionist designs on occupied Palestinian and Arab land than in engaging in serious peace-making -- a route that would require its unreserved commitment.

 In short, if you don't want to exert yourself, buy the neighbor's quota; if you don't want to spend the money, use your brain and invest in the development of nature-conservation technologies. Consequently, if our homeland's efforts boil down merely to dealing in "hot air," this will not provide an impetus to start up high technologies and will knock Russia out of the group of countries that are striving for rational development, above all out of the European Union. This is just the time to recall that the energy requirements of Russian output are among the highest in the world (see graph [omitted here] -- Ed.).

 Renzo Gubert once said that what impressed him most is that local Tibetans enjoy a high level of religious freedom.

 Indeed, the U.S Administration, which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman, is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the United States itself. The ugliest crimes are perpetrated against inmates in U.S. prisons, and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by the U.S. police is so appalling that on several occasions it has led to massive riots. For instance, a bloody riot was ignited in Cincinnati when an Afro-American youth was shot dead for no reason by police officers.

 The coming days and weeks will show whether Israel is actually ready to positively and objectively deal with the Palestinian national rights without trying to maneuver, place obstacles, or set impossible conditions during Zinni's mission. In any case, Zinni's mission is to make sure that certain measures are adopted as soon as possible to pave the road to a political settlement of the Palestinian question. Israel's compliance with the required commitments will be the real test not only of its readiness to facilitate the US envoy's mission but also its readiness to establish a just peace which is in the interest of all parties concerned.

 According to the "Kyoto Protocol," by 2008 - 2012 Japan is supposed to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by six percent from the 1990 level. If Japan is to achieve this goal, it will have to put a lot of effort. It has to restructure the plants and enterprises, introduce new technology, and upgrade production lines. To do all these things, it needs a tremendous amount of money for investment. Never doing anything unprofitable is the nature of Japan. Accordingly, Japan would never readily agree on putting the "Kyoto Protocol" into force. In the course of calculating the gains and losses of the "Kyoto Protocol" and trying to figure out what it should do, Japan found a good excuse. The United States, which has to do the most to implement the "Kyoto Protocol," has come out opposing the draft regulations.

 The announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it (among which is Brazil), only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future.

No one expected the Israeli Government to issue its latest decision restricting President Yasir Arafat's movements and confining him to the city of Ramallah. This is especially true after the Palestinian Authority [PA] carried out the difficult Israeli demands and arrested three individuals whom Israel accuses of assassinating Israeli Minister Rah'avam Ze'evi despite the ramifications that these arrests could have led to on the internal Palestinian arena. However, the awareness, the challenges of the current stage, and the sense of responsibility overcame all the temporary factional considerations.

 Thus, even though Uncle Sam's certain worries are justified, his hegemonic way of setting the rules all by himself is hardly convincing. If the United States chooses to disregard the Geneva Convention the way it follows this time, the legality and sanctity of international law will be substantially reduced. If similar problems occur in the future, other countries will have no universally-acknowledged rules to follow.

 The first is that, once again, the current US administration, faced with a controversial issue, is situating itself alongside the explicit interests of companies in the energy sector. The long- standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government's persistent alignment with their goals. The Enron scandal is already taking a significant political toll of the Bush team, which will tend to increase. But the consequences of the divorce between the US and the international community in the Kyoto Protocol case could be even more serious.

It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack.

 Shortly thereafter, the institution's spokesman, Thomas Dawson, declared "the [Argentine] authorities have to reach the program goals they set for themselves" before they can get any more money. Moreover, he found the measures taken by the government to control the [movement] of foreign exchange and limit the flight of capital were "regrettable", even though these measures were made more flexible later on. According to an eyewitness, this cut and dry, accounting-like decision taken by civil servants, who thus have the power of "life or death" over a country, was not the subject of any debate. It was taken following the presentation of a report by Chile's Thomas Reichmann, the chief of mission who had been sent to Buenos Aires. The figures spoke for themselves. At most, a few differences in sensitivity emerged over whether or not the issue should remain closed from one to two months or if the discussions with Argentina should continue. The latter was adopted in the end. This was the only concession made to a government that has been struggling to restructure its domestic public debt to avoid having the country simply default on its debt.

 In the meantime, our Republic's government has shown our principled position on terrorism on several occasions in accordance with the trend of the international community's opposition to terrorism.

 In that document, the Monterrey Consensus, free trade, the amendment on the distortion with agricultural subsidies, and the treatment of the external debt as fundamental pivotal points, benefit Argentina. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan himself said, in his time, that the situation of indebted, undeveloped countries must be consideed, so as to avoid the repetition of a crisis such as ours. In the documents, Argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the World Bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement. Despite this, it gives a clue to the gap that existed, and still exists, between the reality and the statistics of the international credit agencies.

 The base in Guantanamo Bay was chosen for two reasons. It was chosen first and foremost because it is not US territory and thus no claim can be laid to the rights that the US Constitution guarantees to all prisoners, including foreigners. And second, you can only get into or out of the base on board a US Armed Forces helicopter. Thus not only is it impossible to escape, but the humanitarian associations could never organize a protest rally in such a place.

 Let us content ourselves with reiterating the evidence: Since June 1967, the West Bank and Gaza have been occupied and dominated territories, crushed politically, socially, economically.

Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the Atlantic for the policy pursued in combating climate change. In Europe, the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 March on the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before 1 June this year. With this major decision, the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg. In the United States, on 14 February President Bush presented the US national climate protection program.

 It is worth mentioning that the United States is currently implementing the principle that President George Bush announced following the 11 September attacks, which is that those who are not with him are against him.

New York -- The warlike tone of the State of the Union speech delivered by George Bush Tuesday evening has prompted responses as critical abroad as they are enthusiastic in the United States. Be that as it may, the aim pursued by the White House seems to have been achieved. This is to re-mobilize the country behind the war on terrorism and to prevent Americans, by returning to a more normal life, from concerning themselves chiefly with the daily repercussions of the Enron affair and rising unemployment. 
----
 This is about the following: on 18 January 2002, President Bush publicly announced two decisions, which, owing to the President's firmness in announcing them, seemed unyielding: first, the President said the 158 pro-Taliban fighters brought to Guantanamo Bay were not defined by US courts as prisoners of war; therefore, the United States does not believe it is its duty to grant them prisoner-of-war rights under the Geneva Convention, which regulates (since 1949) the status of this category of detained combatants. In the actual situation we are discussing, the issue is the privileges ensured by the Convention: according to that act, no detained combatant can be forced to reveal to the interrogator anything other than his name, rank, military serial number, and birth date. And, most of all -- this is a very important detail in this case -- the Convention forces the country that holds prisoners of war to release them immediately when the conflict is over.

 Most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers. Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom. These criminals know this fact, as much as we, the Arabs, do, because they are in direct contact with it.

It grudgingly agreed to it only when some countries made concessions and made amendments to the draft.

 It is clearly obvious to the international community that the Palestinians seek peace. It is the Palestinians that are calling for the implementation of the agreements, understandings, and recommendations pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. They believe that these constitute a preliminary step to the resumption of the peace process at the point at which it stopped. They believe that such a step would lead to a permanent settlement of this conflict on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy. The Palestinians believe that such a step would realize their national aspirations to full sovereignty despite the perils and implications that such efforts may have on their national unity that puts the higher Palestinian interests above every other consideration. However, it appears as if the international community is tolerating the Israeli campaign of suppression that contradicts the efforts to calm down the situation and the Palestinian hand that is stretched for peace and a settlement. The Palestinians are sending out a clear message of peace that is loud and clear. However, the repeated Israeli message is the resort to all means to impede the march for peace and to consecrate violence and counter violence.

 Venezuela is the third largest exporter of oil within OPEC and the fourth as far as worldwide production is concerned.

Evidently, during a phone conversation on Friday Chavez told his daughter that he was forced to resign and accept the army's non-negotiable conditions.

 It should be remembered that after Bush described the Kyoto Protocol as "fundamentally flawed" international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed. The United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (25 percent of global emissions) withdrew from an international agreement that, for the first time, set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection. We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change. The European Union played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded, at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year, an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field. This must now be ratified by all the parties and will shortly enter into force. However, all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the United States takes measures that are comparable to these taken by Europe and Japan.

 What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy. Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy. This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe. Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina. Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation.

Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping.

 Therefore, on the issue of defining these prisoners' "status," the United States must test the attitudes of the international community, especially the attitudes of European countries.

 Washington officials refuse this school of thought (which would lead them to refrain from interrogating the prisoners, indeed to release them after the end of the hostilities) but seem to be aware of the fact that here they are not on very solid legal ground. So Rumsfield stated that the prisoners' treatment was "reasonably consistent" with the Geneva Conventions, which was a way of saying, in this particular case, that the US was the only judge of what was "reasonable." That, however, is the problem. Just as is the fact that "the" US Al-Qa'ida fighter, John Walker Lindh, will not be shut up in one of the four square meter cages at Guantanamo but sent to a US prison and tried by a normal court.

 If the US, which claims to be the world's policeman, is incapable of looking beyond US interests or of practicing the universal values of human rights, democracy and peace, then shouldn't the international community reconsider the role played by the UN, or learn from the way the European parliament works?

It is also an approach better suited to the new century and its increasing international diversity.

 Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened. A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration. In December 2001, the UK proclaimed a state of emergency and passed the Antiterrorism, Crime, and Security Act. Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned. If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law.

 But instead of reciprocating, Israel, the state that since its creation has benefited most from US protection and backing, has turned out to be a fair-weather friend. Its self-seeking manipulation of the tragedy, which, if Tel Aviv has not noticed, has affected every corner of the earth, adds yet another burden upon Washington. Sharon's likening of his invasion of Palestinian territories and the assassinations to the US-led war against the Taleban and Osama Ben Laden is abhorrent. Sharon's deceptive ploys cannot negate the fact that President Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority have and are still, even while under attack, doing their utmost to demonstrate their unambiguous commitment to stop violence, maintain the ceasefire, and get back to negotiations.

 Past weeks' Incidents, President Arafat's cease-fire declaration, the anti-violence campaign, the other activities that Israel brands terrorism, and Israel's unjustified escalation show that Palestinians are totally committed to the peace process and the previous agreements and understandings.

US envoy Zinni is supposed to have realized these clear-cut facts through his reading of the latest developments in the region.

 They are relatively mild for our country. We are not required to reduce emissions, but over five years (from 2008 through 2012) we do not have the right to exceed their volume. This approach is based on the fact that Russia's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990, and, according to forecasts, the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years. This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020, which the government has adopted. Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of, and monitor, emissions and emission quotas, as well as regulate quotas. This requires creating a national system of inventorying emissions and establishing a special registration center to maintain records of quotas. Despite the outward complexity of the task, the creation of a record-keeping and monitoring system is neither very complicated nor very expensive, since the Goskomstat [State Statistical Committee] reporting forms that enterprises fill out contain virtually complete data.

 The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America]. American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security. This is while possessing arms for self-defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity. Critics of the meeting, on the margin of the conference, up held the view that the American government, instead of heeding the wishes of international community, and protecting the security of world nations, and above all the safety of its own citizens, has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments. (It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [legal force] even for the participating countries.) [Sentences are as published] The most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in Genova; perhaps even more so for the results "not obtained" at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting. The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and ... [as published] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues, but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty. The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization, who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty. When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations, things got out of hand; the already volatile situation reached boiling point, violent clashes broke out, and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues. The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies, and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates.

 It has long been known that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has influence on Chavez, who has asked him for advice more than once. The US Government itself considers him a kind of link for dealing with the situation in Venezuela. That situation has changed considerably since Chavez issued, by decree, a package of 49 laws of a nationalizing character. Those laws affect almost everything in the country, from petroleum to land ownership. Shortly after that, on the occasion of the attack on the twin towers in New York, Chavez said that the US reaction to Taliban terrorism was also a terrorist act, thereby straining his relations with Washington.

 The United States and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 September attacks.

And they placed the stress on the battle of endurance that must follow.

 This was the case in particular for Russia, Brazil and now Pakistan. In the case of Russia, it was a matter of helping the former soviet giant consolidate its emerging democracy. For Brazil, the Fund intervened in October 1998, between two rounds in the presidential election, to support Fernando Henrique Cardoso's reelection because his macroeconomic options fell in line with the Fund's requirements, contrary to his leftist adversary, Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva. In the case of Pakistan, it is this country's geostrategic position in the current crisis that serves to justify the avalanche of loans and trade facilities that are being granted to Islamabad.

 Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others. But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life. Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman. That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party. It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign.

 The Israeli withdrawal was a correction of a mistake the Israeli Government made when it decided to reoccupy parts of the main West Bank cities following the assassination of Israeli minister Rehav'am Ze'evi. The reoccupation was a kind of collective punishment for the inhabitants of those cities and the villages around them, villages that constitute an organic and vital extension of the cities. The Israeli forces destroyed buildings and installations in those cities, arrested dozens of citizens, and killed dozens others. That showed that the ruling right-wing coalition in Israel is pursuing an occupational policy and is not, in the first place, willing to recognize the firm national Palestinian rights to freedom, independence, and the end of occupation and settlement.

 Oil prices took a sharp downward trend after the quiet semi-coup d'etat by the American affiliated Venezuelan army generals who deposed the popularly elected president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Friday. The price of crude had taken a dramatic upsurge in the aftermath of the ever-deteriorating Middle East crisis, the unilateral cut off of Iraqi oil by Saddam Hussein and similar threats by several other oil producing countries. The dethroning of Chavez by the Americans is a message that disobeying Uncle Sam would have cataclysmic consequences.

 Emphasizing the significance of the adoption of the "Kyoto Protocol," Japan loudly trumpeted at that time that the adoption of the protocol was "produced by the role" Japan had played. Japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force. Nonetheless, Japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force and even called for liquidation of the draft. This shows how capricious Japan is and how frequently it changes its stand when the stakes matter the most. Of course, behind the Japan's behavior lies its stakes.

 Today, two forms of terrorism fuel each other. Palestinian terrorism, which existed on a very small scale in the time of Yitzhak Rabin, has taken on a dramatic dimension. But the Israeli response, with its "extra-judicial liquidations," is even more dramatic in a certain sense. It now resembles the destruction of the very people, so structured and organized is it.

 There is, in the first place, the case of the military action in Afghanistan. Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation. Back in 1949, it was agreed by nearly all the states in the world that the sufferings of war must henceforth become more bearable, especially for those who are not directly involved in the conflict. These rules, laid down in the four Geneva Conventions, provide, among other things, for the protection of sick and wounded servicemen and prisoners of war. In addition, attempts must be made to prevent any unnecessary suffering by both military personnel and civilians by, for instance, imposing restrictions on the use of weapons.

 This state of affairs provides suitable conditions to Israel to continue its occupation, colonialism, and building of settlements that have been imposed by military force on the Palestinian territories since 1967 to date. These Israeli aims are clear and do not need further clarification or explanation. Israel's impossible terms cannot be met by a nation that is determined to preserve its dignity and national unity. They are no more than frail excuses and pretexts to evade the peace process since this process does not agree with the ideology of expansion and the building of settlements. This ideology was explicitly embraced by the rightist blocs in the ruling Israeli coalition and is implicitly encouraged by Labor Party ministers in the current Israeli Government.

 One cannot underestimate the significance of the fact that Russia has opened its airspace.

And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps in this regard.

 Earlier this week, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel, threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem. European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the EU should consider imposing an economic "punishment" on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories. The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah.

 Since 11 September, the US has behaved as if it had a sort of natural right to create law. Because they had been the victims of terrorist attacks and, more deeply, because Americans are "good," even if, as President Bush had explained, the world did not always realize "how good they were." Until now, this right-this right right, if one prefers-has more or less been accepted by Washington's partners. The distress generated by one photograph published inadvertently or through excess self-confidence might only mean that this consensus is in the process of eroding. And that the Europeans, in particular, are no longer quite ready to follow the Americans in their way of thinking.

 The changes made by Chavez in his team expose the cracks in the coalition. In response to the reaction in the street, the radical wing opposes any agreement with opposition groups. The moderate wing supports dialogue with the opposition to try to reduce political tension. As the opposition raises its head, the climate of plots takes shape. The noise from the pots and pans does a poor job of hiding the opposition's desire to launch a kind of civil disobedience, an indication that Venezuela has finally entered a dangerous stage.

 This Arab position is actually not new. The key party to the conflict with Israel, the Palestinians, have long argued that they were ready to accept the occupied territories, which amount to only 22 per cent of historic Palestine, as their own independent state. But what makes this offer exceptionally generous is the readiness of a key Arab leader to take this stand at the highest Arab political forum and campaign for it. The Arab argument of yesteryears was that peace could be established between Israel and the "front-line" states -- Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians -- but the remaining Arab states are not obligated to establish diplomatic relations with Israel.

 Looking back one can see a general lack of vigilance. Also on the part of the International Monetary Fund whose principal role is to be watchdog before bailing out those who come unstuck. Michael Mussa, chief economist with the IMF until last April, recognizes this: "If we had paid more attention to the growing budgetary deficit and national debt between 1996 and 1998, Argentina would have been in a much better position to absorb the impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian real."
