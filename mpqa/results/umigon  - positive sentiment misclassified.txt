 After four years of arduous negotiations, the Marrakesh conference ended successfully at 0600 hours last Saturday. Its objective was to complete the regulations governing the Kyoto Protocol and thereby create political and technical conditions for the latter's ratification by the international community.

 The political accords reached in New York were noteworthy, because the Argentine Government supported all of the US Government's present and future needs in the war in Afghanistan. But those were the US needs.

 Nobody who has a live conscience and human feelings, whether he is Palestinian or otherwise, could not have been moved by these events and expressed sympathy for the families of the US victims, regardless of the US political stances that are totally biased to Israel and Israel's use of the most advanced US weapons to curb the Palestinian intifadah. This is because the Palestinians were, and still are, hoping that the Americans would realize, if they have not already realized, the justice of the Palestinian cause and the enormous injustice suffered by the Palestinians, who were expelled from their homeland, whose land was occupied, and who were deprived of the minimum political and human rights. 
----
 It is very important for the United States to realize the difference between the US and Israeli cases. The Palestinians want nothing from Washington but to understand their cause and stand beside right and justice. What is required of Israel is to withdraw, both on the military and settlement fronts, from the territories occupied in 1967, and the United States should push its ally Israel in that direction. This would put an end to sensitivities, hatred, and injustice and spread peace in the region and the world. 
----
 It would have perhaps been logical and acceptable if Washington had demanded a mutual and concurrent cessation of the ongoing violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and called on Israel not to exploit the calm to open the files of security revenge through assassinations and arrests. It would have been logical and acceptable if Washington had asked Israel to announce its commitment to the principle of withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 and to end the settlement activity. Such demands constitute the strong base for bringing about calm and stability, putting a final end to violence and terrorism, and turning a new leaf toward fruitful negotiations leading to a just peace acceptable by all sides.

 Mr Mbeki's stance on the elections signals a oneness that the continent has not enjoyed in the past and lack of which the West has exploited to put into power their puppets.

 At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States "did not show the slightest sympathy," still less "the least regret," for the breaking-off of Venezuela's democratic system. Both the White House and the US State Department expressed "satisfaction" over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one "wept over him." Besides, they also claimed that Chavez "had only himself to blame" for the coup. When Chavez resumed power, a senior US official in charge of national security commented that "Chavez should reflect on himself," as "his ship has been sailing towards a wrong direction for far too long."

 True, this position makes one think of Yemelya's [illusory] happiness and worry about the future development of the country (both technological and economic as a whole). Fortunately, supporters of the idea of lying on a stove found an opponent.

 As seen in the above, the world's public sentiment stands on the side of justice. The denunciation and rejection of injustice and the support and encouragement to justice, evident in the February international developments, do reflect change in the 21st-century international relations in which imperialists are weakening and aspirations to independence are strengthening. The general situation in the new century is making turns in favor of the independent developments of progressive nations including our country.

 If, however, US President George W. Bush still believes in the supremacy of human rights, he must not forget the breeding ground for terrorists that exists within the anti-terrorist alliance. The US is planning to extend military aid to several countries in the alliance to enable them to root out terrorists without using US forces. Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights.

 The attack on the World Trade Centre was particularly disheartening to a fledgling Arab and Muslim American community that had made a tremendous amount of progress in introducing Arabs and Muslims as legitimate political constituents on the American political scene. It was once hoped that a well-organised Arab and Muslim community in the United States could curb the attacks on Arabs and Muslims in the media and start to do what Arab and Muslim governments had not done by injecting the Arab viewpoint into the American political discourse.

 Those covenants contain insufficient guarantees in themselves to achieve the Belgian/Flemish reduction targets in an economically efficient manner.

 This being the case, it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities. Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation, ending settlement construction activities, and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.

The hero of the Gulf War, Colin Powell, did not exactly cover himself in glory in his diplomatic mission to the Middle East as the US president's envoy. His task was to create "a peaceful environment" in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine.

 No one had gone so far in the anthology of rhetorical follies, or in falsifying history. No one had ever tried to compare themselves to, and put themselves in the same position, as the founders of the nation, as the thwarted leader of the 4 February 1992 coup has now tried to do. What is there about a coup against the constitutional order that could resemble the most important day in Venezuelan history? In what way can Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez be seen as comparable to Jose Felix Ribas, Francisco Salias, the philosopher Juan German Roscio, or Canon Jose Cortes de Madariaga? 
----
 This policy, which disregards the need to establish a just peace based on the need for the Palestinian people to regain their freedom and independence, is reflected in statements made by the Israeli officials, who brag about the large number of Palestinians who were killed or arrested by the Israeli forces. It is also reflected in the fact that the ruling Israeli coalition has no agreed-upon political plan and that the settlement plans and initiatives that are attributed to this Israeli official or that are unable to meet the minimum legitimate Palestinian demands. These initiatives and plans largely try to keep as much hegemony and as many settlements as possible on Palestinian lands, resources, airspace, and crossing points.

 The Argentine Foreign Ministry had previously stopped importuning Brasilia to have Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Argentine President De la Rua meet jointly with Bush, as they had agreed to do at the most recent meeting between the two countries in Sao Paulo. That sort of meeting would have lent a noteworthy twist to the Argentine case.

 The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected. Observance of these rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion. 
----
 The United States realizes that the Palestinians are serious in their efforts to achieve a just peace. The Palestinians left no avenue unexplored in their quest for a settlement that enables them to regain their legitimate rights and provides all the peoples of the region, including the Israelis, with security and stability. It is, therefore, unfair to blame the PA for the tension, and sometimes violence, that takes place as a result of the Israeli oppressive measures and activities. Every oppressive or vindictive Israeli action has a Palestinian reaction that cannot be stopped. Before 1994, Israel was in control of all the occupied Palestinian territories and yet it was unable, despite all its forces, weapons, and measures, to achieve full and comprehensive quiet in the West Bank and Gaza throughout 27 years. 
----
 Israel's provocation is too harsh to be tolerated. The Israeli Government says it should have a free hand to storm the Palestinian areas; assassinate or arrest Palestinian citizens; demolish homes, headquarters, and establishments; uproot thousands of trees; and besiege cities and villages as it likes. While committing themselves to peace, Palestinians bear this patiently and suppress fury, hoping that the US-dominated world community will acknowledge that Palestinians seek calm and a just peace in order to end occupation and settlement in their territories and to enjoy freedom, dignity, and independence, like other world nations.

 This time around, the tide has changed and the Saudi leader's willingness to take this unprecedented step merits more than positive responses from Israel and the United States. It demands immediate action.

 With the protocol in effect, it will be possible to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the industrialized countries and, consequently, to combat the global warming of the atmosphere for the benefit and well-being of future generations all over the planet.

 For many reasons, the occupation of Palestinian towns cannot last, so the Zionist forces will have to withdraw from these towns sooner or later. In addition, it is now more impossible than ever to control the movement of three million Palestinians. This is actually one of the deep-rooted facts.

 In the meantime, our Republic's government has shown our principled position on terrorism on several occasions in accordance with the trend of the international community's opposition to terrorism. We have signed and joined anti-terrorist treaties such as International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. We have thus actively contributed to the preservation of global peace and security.

Recent weeks have seen important developments on both sides of the Atlantic for the policy pursued in combating climate change. In Europe, the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 March on the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before 1 June this year. With this major decision, the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg. In the United States, on 14 February President Bush presented the US national climate protection program.

 The condemnation of the "axis of evil" comprising Iran, Iraq, and North Korea was applauded by Republican and Democrat hawks, and barely challenged by a few foreign relations experts. George Bush has succeeded not only in returning the war to the front pages of the newspapers, ousting the Enron affair and the budget deficit, but also in forcing the Democratic opposition to unite against the enemy. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, and Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, have attempted the impossible feat of "setting partisan attitudes aside and supporting our President 100 percent in the war on terrorism," while at the same time trying to criticize economic and social policy.

 The IHRC said that all nations and religions condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. The solidarity would bring about an international campaign to dry up the roots of terrorism and expand peace and security in the international community, but, certain countries resort to military power and embark on trampling upon human rights of civilians.

 Since Sharon refuses to offer the Palestinians their own state with acceptable borders and conditions, there are two alternatives left. One would think that no politically prudent Israeli could support either of them.

 The second big challenge was to regulate in detail the compensation mechanisms for reducing emissions. The one that interests us in particular is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which applies to countries such as Brazil. The proper regulation as finally achieved represents a balance between restrictions on free use of the mechanisms so as to ensure that the reductions are real--that is, physical and not just bookkeeping exercises--and, at the same time, to keep some flexibility in the controls so as not to burden the compensation transactions excessively. It was possible to ensure the environmental integrity of the protocol and to maintain control over the mechanism.

 The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions. Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers? Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons.

 But instead of reciprocating, Israel, the state that since its creation has benefited most from US protection and backing, has turned out to be a fair-weather friend. Its self-seeking manipulation of the tragedy, which, if Tel Aviv has not noticed, has affected every corner of the earth, adds yet another burden upon Washington. Sharon's likening of his invasion of Palestinian territories and the assassinations to the US-led war against the Taleban and Osama Ben Laden is abhorrent. Sharon's deceptive ploys cannot negate the fact that President Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority have and are still, even while under attack, doing their utmost to demonstrate their unambiguous commitment to stop violence, maintain the ceasefire, and get back to negotiations.

 The US expects its friends to provide it with understanding, cooperation and full support in confronting the perpetrators of the devastating attack on its centres of economic and military power.

 It seems that following the blow that the Americans received on September 11 in New York and Washington, the United States is determined to take justice to pre-historic times. It is obvious no country will put up with this cruelty. No one will allow this human achievement, which is the discovery of God-given human rights, which is achieved after thousands of years of research, to be wasted away.

 Our Republic is currently making every possible effort to reclaim national sovereignty by reunifying the fatherland as soon as possible and safeguard peace and security on the Korean peninsula and of Northeast Asia. Our Republic is also fiercely waging a fight against war or the exercise of military force in resolving international issues and is seeking ways to combat terrorism, and the international community is praising these efforts.

 Brazil contributed greatly to the success in Marrakesh.

 This Arab position is actually not new. The key party to the conflict with Israel, the Palestinians, have long argued that they were ready to accept the occupied territories, which amount to only 22 per cent of historic Palestine, as their own independent state. But what makes this offer exceptionally generous is the readiness of a key Arab leader to take this stand at the highest Arab political forum and campaign for it. The Arab argument of yesteryears was that peace could be established between Israel and the "front-line" states -- Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians -- but the remaining Arab states are not obligated to establish diplomatic relations with Israel.
