 Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste. Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely. There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested.

Since the 11 September events in America, that country's administration has severely restricted the civil rights of the American people, particularly the foreigners residing in that country. It has done so through passing the anti-terrorism law, issuing presidential directives, and sending secret memoranda to the judiciary under the pretext of fighting terrorism. One such measure was a directive issued on 23 November concerning the creation of military courts for trying immigrants and foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. This has drawn a chorus of condemnation from the democrats in Congress, foreign governments and civil right activists in that country. According to the directive, which is considered by many American lawyers to be in contravention of the country's constitution, judicial investigations into the cases of the defendants in military courts will be conducted without any possibility of bail. Nor will they be allowed to appeal to American or international courts. Currently around 1,100 suspects, who are chiefly from Islamic Middle Eastern states, are being held in detention. They have been divested of many of their basis rights, and their voices cannot be heard by anyone. The decision by Bush to create a military court for the trial of terrorist suspects has prompted European states, particularly Spain, to refuse to hand over to America more than 10 individuals suspected of belonging to terrorist groups. They fear that these suspects may not receive a fair trial in America. America, which always accuses other countries of violating human rights, is today placing terrorist suspects, who may even be innocent, in solitary confinement without access to any means of mass communication, thus depriving them of the basic human rights, in contravention of its own constitution. And, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, it violates human rights - rights which are global. In the 23 November directive, Bush has in effect drawn a clear line between the rights of American citizens and foreign immigrants. This is a blatant case of discrimination in rights - something which is not practised anywhere else in the world. It is worth mentioning that in the past America had severely criticized and put pressure on other governments in the world for trying terrorist suspects in military courts. The American State Department had in 1999 condemned the government of Peru for the creation of a secret military court, and called on that country to accept international regulations, such as the need for open and fair trials and observance of defendants' basic rights. The recent action of the American president clearly demonstrates the need for the American administration to observe human rights. Moreover, it places this country, which claims to be a forerunner in the sphere of human rights in the world, in the same rank as countries which restrict civil rights under the pretext of security considerations. It appears that if the directive issued by Bush becomes law, then that country's re-entry into the UN Human Rights Commission, from which it was expelled this year, will become much more difficult.

 Regarding the major contents and purpose of Bush's speech at Tsinghua University, it was, as overseas public opinion had expected, a promotion of US values to China. In an editorial, Hong Kong's Shang Pao pointed out that in the course of reform and opening up, the United States is a country that the Chinese people want to understand the most and that the United States is a country that is easiest to understand. Not only today, 10 years ago or even in the early days of China's reform and opening up, the broad mass of the Chinese people, young college students in particular, know about US values. The Chinese people not only understand American democracy, freedom, religions, and human rights, they also know quite well about American social, economic, and political problems, which is beyond Bush's imagination. That's why a student asked Bush yesterday how to handle social problems including the problem of the violation of human rights, which is getting worse day after day in the!

 Not only with the protection of the civilian population does something sometimes go wrong.

That would amount to a flagrant violation of humanitarian law: whoever ceases fighting for whatever reason is entitled to protection. It is all the more to be deplored that such statements come from somebody who, as a senior commander, serves as an example to others regarding the observance of rules of humanitarian law.

 At the same time, the leader of the Taiwanese authorities gradually promoted the so-called "correcting the name of Taiwan." Recently, the Taiwan "Press Bureau" stopped using the symbol with the map of China. Taiwanese authorities concerned forced a Taiwanese NGO to change the word of "China" in its English annual. Now, the Taiwanese authorities wants to add the English word of "Taiwan" on Taiwanese travel documents. All these activities to "change the name of Taiwan," along with the Taiwanese authorities' comprehensive policies of "separating from China" in ideology, culture, history, education and the media, are all attempts to separate Taiwan from China, and change its status as a part of China. The purpose is to create conditions for the final public announcement of "Taiwan independence." The development of these events fully indicates that the leader of the Taiwanese authorities has not only not given up his stance of "Taiwan independence" but also used the method of nibbling to promote "gradual Taiwan independence."

 The fact that the President reconsidered his own statement of 18 January led to diverse reactions. There is irony -- including from the sober The New York Times , which wrote in its Tuesday issue that in his Monday speech the President "twice called the 158 pro-Taliban fighters 'prisoners,' then stopped himself, and used the word 'detainees.'" At first sight, this seems to be nothing more than a terminology issue. However, I believe it is more than that. In this concern about details -- about cold-blood accomplices to murder, because that is what these al-Qa'ida disciples at Guantanamo Bay are -- the US Administration proves it is capable of admitting it is not infallible, which is the equivalent of respect for democracy. And, as a last detail, let us remember that, harassed everywhere by journalists and commentators, no US leader ever thought of finding "monkeys" [reference to a statement made by Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase] among media workers or scapegoats among the weirdoes who use hundreds of websites to call on the administration to stop supporting the Jews or to exterminate the Arabs.

 A few days ago the Israeli prime minister himself referred to the Lebanon war, and in so doing voiced his regret that Palestinian leader Arafat was not killed by Israel at that time. Sharon, who as defense minister in 1982 headed the Israeli Lebanon invasion, at that time -- as was determined by Israel's Supreme Court -- shared responsibility for the massacres in the Palestinian Sabra and Shatila refugee camps and therefore lost his government post in 1983. Sharon, who back then caused serious damage to Israel's international reputation, is well on his way to doing so again. Militarily Israel can win the war against the Palestinians because of its strength; politically -- in the eyes of the world's public -- it looks different. The question arises for the Israeli Labor Party of how long it can still justify a coalition with Sharon. It must be clear to all who want peace that it is time for a different policy.

 The Kazakh Oil national oil company's enterprises produced 4.9m t of oil in the [first] nine months of this year, that is 11.6 per cent up year on year. The extraction of oil over and above the plan - 336,000 t - was possible due to the launching of new wells and measures taken to intensify the production process, the company's press service reports. An increase in the extraction was possible thanks to the company's active investment policy which has been conducted since 2000, the press service says. Capital investments in production increased by 37 per cent in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period of 2000. Capital was invested in renewing the main facilities, increasing volumes of drilling and wells and upgrading them. The company processed 1,697,000 t of oil and fully provided the Atyrau oil refinery [in the west of the country] with oil. Kazakh Oil paid more than 34bn tenge [the current exchange rate is 148 tenge to the dollar] to the budget in the period, that is 60 per cent up year on year...

 As for all the ideas regarding blocking shields, umbrellas and the like, I will answer this way. The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change. There are no proposals there to erect screens or to shoot cooling aerosols into the atmosphere. Already everything humankind does causes incredible damage to nature. We emit greenhouse gases, we thaw out the frozen regions that emit methane, we destroy forests, and in the south, deserts are expanding, a process that alters the heat exchange between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. That is, all of our actions are accompanied by a deterioration in the climate. In this situation it is very frightening to do anything else -- for example, to suspend some umbrella, screen or something else in that vein.

[First announcer] Hugo Chavez was ousted today as a result of a coup d'etat. Please pay attention to a commentary on this issue. [second announcer] In a rare development, which reminds one of the American-backed coup d'etat by General Pinochet against the legally-elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende, in 1973, the legally-elected President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was ousted as a result of coordinated operations carried out by a number of army generals, as well as prominent industrialists, capitalists and forces acting as American agents. Venezuela is one of the largest oil producers and exporters in the world. It has vast natural resources and riches. However, despite the passage of 170 years since its independence, it is one of the poorest countries in the world. More than 80 per cent of its population live below the poverty line. Indeed, that is the fate of many Latin and South American countries which have been living for decades under American-backed military regimes that oppressed their own peoples. [passage omitted: On developments in Venezuela after World War II] As a result of developments in the 1990s, Hugo Chavez was elected in the free elections held in 1998. He gained the votes of the vast majority of voters and immediately declared that the aim of his government was to eliminate poverty and injustice and guarantee the independence of his country in the face of foreign interference. Chavez's policies were aimed at eliminating injustice and poverty in his country. Thus he introduced reforms in the economic and commercial arenas, as well as in the oil [industry]. As a result, industrialists and prominent capitalists, as well as defeated political forces acting as foreign agents and the military figures associated with them, became concerned about the situation. Gradually, this led to the formation of a coalition. Indeed, the officials of the Chavez government repeatedly said that foreign intelligence agencies were involved in the formation of that coalition. As far as the issue of foreign policy was concerned, Chavez sought to preserve the independence of his country in the face of American pressure. He pursued an independent policy. One of the main objectives of his policies was to properly utilize Venezuela's vast natural riches, namely oil. In this way, he sought to implement his policy of eliminating poverty. Moreover, Chavez's foreign policies were contrary to American interests in Latin America, as well as in other parts of the world. In Latin and South America, Hugo Chavez established close and friendly relations with Cuban President Fidel Castro and invited him to visit his country. He also supported movements that opposed American intervention in the region, thereby infuriating Washington. That was particularly because his policies enjoyed widespread support among regional countries. Washington was concerned that the Chavez model might affect other [Latin] American countries. Moreover, America also openly opposed Chavez's policies of establishing friendly relations with certain countries that pursued independent regional and international policies. Nevertheless, the most important reason for America's concern was the issue of oil. This issue is closely intertwined with America's policies towards the Middle East. Following Iran's proposal on cutting off the supply of oil to countries that support Israel for one month, which was supported by some oil-exporting countries, there was an increasing probability that Venezuela would also support [the proposal]. Therefore, the ouster of the Chavez government was an effective solution. It also served the interests of the forces that opposed Chavez inside [Venezuela]. Therefore, it seems that the coup d'etat in Venezuela should be assessed as a plot that was hatched for that purpose.

The elected president of the people of Venezuela, "Hugo Chavez" [punctuation as published here and throughout], has once more taken up the reins of power at the presidential palace in Caracas. The rapid events and the changing of power in Venezuela indicate that the putschists did not enjoy a popular base and the Venezuelan people as well as the military in the country did not endorse the coup government of "Pedro Carmona" who was being supported by America. America was the only country that came to the support of the putschists immediately after they took power in Venezuela. Moreover, in its posturing with respect to this country, America declared that democracy had been victorious in Venezuela. America called the action of several military generals, who were supported by capitalist as well as bankers, as the victory of democracy in Venezuela under circumstances where Hugo Chavez had come to power in 1988 through a popular process. What is more, the promoting of a constitutional reform plan and carrying out of extensive economic reforms have led to his re-election in July 2000 as the president of Venezuela for a further six year term. A number of observers believe that the reasons behind America's opposition to Chavez and its support for Venezuela under the generals who carried out the coup against him go back to the domestic and foreign plans and policies of Chavez. Following a series of domestic reforms, especially in the agriculture, energy and banking sectors and describing communism and capitalism as futile, Chavez caused the business leaders, bankers and capitalist to distance themselves from him and thus paved the way for their opposition to his power. The new laws were described by leaders of the economy as deviant and unfair and these leaders organised and stage-managed street demonstrations against Chavez with the help of the biggest trade and commercial unions as well as a sector of the army. Outside the borders of Venezuela, Chavez faced America's hostility. This is something that the American officials have acknowledged on many occasions. They had been thinking about ways of ousting Chavez from the presidential palace in Caracas. Ever since he came to power, Chavez had refused to accept America's biding and had called on Washington on numerous occasions to stop intervening in his country. He also accused America of killing innocent children and people during the Afghan war, met with "Mo'ammar Qadhafi" and "Saddam Hoseyn", the presidents of Libya and Iraq and long-term enemies of Washington, and had a very close relationship with the Cuban leader "Fidel Castro". The combination of Chavez's performance and policies brought on the wrath of American President Bush to the extent that he failed to hide his anger during his visit to Peru. During his meetings with Peruvian officials, Bush spoke of America's dislike of Chavez. Moreover, the American Secretary of State "Powell" also has recently announced in his annual report to the American Congress that taking into account Hugo Chavez's closeness to countries that are not dependent on America, he is not considered to be a trustworthy pawn in the Latin American region. Powell had stressed that Venezuela is able to, as in the past, that is to say, the era of the military rule in that country, play an effective role in America's policies in Latin America. Besides these instances of American hostility towards Chavez, mention must be made of his oil policy within OPEC. In recent years, Chavez caused OPEC oil policies to be strengthened in the face of the positions adopted by oil consumers. He has managed to a great extent to adopt policies aligned with other oil producing states whenever oil crises have emerged that led to reduced oil prices in the market. That is to say, he adopted positions where supply of oil by OPEC would be reduced and oil prices supported. This is while before Chavez, Venezuela used to be called the "errant member" within OPEC, a member that would follow less the concerted decisions of OPEC and observe less its own quotas. This is why one cannot dismiss the effects of the intensification of the Middle East crisis, Iraq's initiative in using crude oil as a political weapon against Washington and the debate on an extensive oil embargo against the supporters of Israel on the events of the past few days in Venezuela as well as America's support for the putschists there. America was trying to guarantee the flow of Venezuelan crude oil to itself by overthrowing Chavez and the seizing of power in the Venezuelan presidential palace by the dependent generals. The people of Venezuela thwarted America in this. Finally, America prescribes liberal democracy for others yet fails itself to accord any value to democratic principles in the world. The Bush administration's support for the Venezuelan putschists is testament to this. Attachments: Image-1.gif Image-2.gif

 For those owing less than $100,000, the conversion will be done at the rate of one to one. For those who owe between $100,000 and $300,000, the conversion rate will be 1.2 to 1, with the government making up the difference between this rate and that of the official dollar. It will help out the banks, as El Cronista reported, by giving them a bond or certificate against future revenues from the tax on crude oil exports (5 billion) and with part of the assistance that the IMF will reportedly provide (4 billion).

 Beijing, Jan. 12 (Yonhap) -- Criminals have been increasingly preying on Korean travellers and residents in China with the increase of exchanges between the two countries since the opening of diplomatic relations in 1992. Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said.

The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice. As a result, the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963, Dominican Republic in 1984, Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled.

 According to a report, a majority of the residents even within the United States are denouncing Bush's reckless remarks. As a matter of fact, the fellow who wrote Bush's address inevitably submitted his resignation. Foreign news reported that the US White House announced that David Frum, a White House official who wrote President Bush's address, had submitted his resignation. This, in fact, signifies that he inevitably had to leave the White House, driven out by the anti-Bush hot winds from around the world. The US imperialist war maniacs are clinging to a new conspiracy in order to escape such a predicament and divert the arrows aimed at them in other directions. What they have crafted out of this was our so-called sales of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] and ballistic missiles and concerned technology sales. In order to add credibility to the US imperialist war maniacs' conspiracy, they did not forget to label our country as the number one country in WMD and ballistic missiles sales and concerned technology sales that were already mentioned. How accustomed they are to trickery! However, no one will fall for their acts.

 Seoul, Nov. 19 (Yonhap) -- The recent settlement of details regarding the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert. The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech, Morocco at the start of the month. If the protocol, which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases, is put into effect, the nation's export will be heavily damaged. The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union (EU) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990's. The government and business circle expect the nation's exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008, when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol. The reason is that South Korea's industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol. Also, advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier. Moreover, the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen. South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers, and Korea's per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries. Under this situation, the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations. In particular, Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States' ratification of the protocol. The U.S. backed out of the agreement, saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore. Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018, there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then. If things go on like this, the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment-friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing. The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency. According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol's requirements. "The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption," an industry source said. Unless measures that comply with the Kyoto Protocol are mapped out early, the nation's competitiveness in manufacturing sectors will weaken soon. sunglok@yna.co.kr

 Moscow, 21 January: President Vladimir Putin visited the Khrunichev space centre on Monday evening [21 January]. In one of the workshops, he was told in detail about manned and unmanned spacecraft. The centre's chief, Aleksandr Medvedev, reported to the president about the development of Russia's segment on board the International Space Station [ISS]. Rosaviakosmos Director Yuriy Koptev, in his turn, told the president that, at present, Russia was actively interacting with European countries on "the interchangeability" of the ISS' American segment. Koptev explained that the USA has suspended the ISS development programme until a deficit of 4.7bn dollars is paid off. According to Koptev, such interaction with Europe would make it possible for six spacemen to be on board the ISS rather than the current three, as well as to use a Russian Soyuz rocket as a rescue spaceship. The director-general of the Khrunichev centre briefed the head of state on how the heavy Proton rocket-booster had been upgraded. According to the director, it is this rocket booster that launches almost all of Russia's military and civilian satellites into space. According to Medvedev, the main upgrading work included "the replacement of the control system, improvement of design data, the determination of ecological measures at the first stage, and the improvement of the rocket-booster at the boosting unit's expense." The upgrading and especially the last part - the boosting unit - have made it possible "to surge on the foreign market" and provided for a great economic and commercial effect from the launch of an upgraded Proton rocket-booster, said Medvedev. In all, since the first launch of Proton in 1965, according to Medvedev, 284 launches of this rocket have been made, all from the Baykonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Accompanying the president at the Khrunichev centre are Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, deputy chief of Presidential Administration, Sergey Prikhodko; chief of staff, Anatoliy Kvashnin, presidential assistant, Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, Deputy Defence Minister Aleksey Moskovskiy and Space Forces Commander Anatoliy Perminov.

MOSCOW. March 24 (Interfax) - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov on Sunday evening is beginning a foreign tour, during which he will pay official visits to Mongolia and Vietnam. He will be visiting Ulan-Bator on March 25 and 26, and Hanoi on March 26 to 28. In Mongolia Kasyanov is to meet with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar, parliament Chairman Timur Ogir and President Natsagiyin Bagabandi. The plan of Kasyanov's visit also included expanded talks and the signing of bilateral documents. The Russian prime minister will meet with Mongolian and Russian businessmen. The main goal of the visit is to broaden economic cooperation between the two countries, whose present-day pace is not fast enough. Russian-Mongolian trade currently amounts to $240 million and makes up only 25% of Mongolia's foreign trade turnover. Mongolia's negative balance in trade with Russia increased from $150 million in 2000 to $160 million in 2001. Russia has proposed improving the situation by increasing exports of Mongolian meat to Russia. In recent years, three joint ventures - the Erdenet mining company, the Mongolian-Russian Non-Ferrous Metals Company and the Ulan- Bator Railways, have accounted for 60% of the Mongolian exports and 40% of the GDP. Russia would like to increase its stake in Erdenet from the current 49%, but Mongolia is also interested in increasing its 51% stake. This issue is likely to be discussed in Ulan-Bator, since the 1991 agreement on this company expires on December 31, 2002. Among other projects which Russian companies would like to implement in Mongolia are the laying of a gas pipeline from Russia to China (Yukos), the gasification of individual districts of Mongolia (Gazprom, Itera) and electricity exports to Mongolia (Unified Energy Systems of Russia.) Mongolia is one of the few members of the former social camp to which Russia does not owe anything. On the contrary, Mongolia's debt to Russia on current operations amounts to $10 million, and its Soviet-era debt to $11.5 billion. Russia is prepared to discuss restructuring and deferment schemes with the Mongolian leadership. Military cooperation, curtailed in the 1990s and now being resumed, will also be on the agenda. The parties are to discuss the training of Mongolian military personnel at Russian military academies and arms exports. Kasyanov will fly to Hanoi from Ulan-Bator on March 26.

As regards the recent conference (Bonn Meeting), although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions.

 Apparently President Bush's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche. This can be traced back to the events in 1818, when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks. Since then, the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living. The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made a harsh appraisal of the situation in Argentina in a private conversation with a group of Swedish businessmen last Friday in Stockholm. He said that, in face of the economic and government paralysis, it is not possible to rule out the risk of a breakdown in the nation's institutions. "There is concern over a degeneration of the democratic process in Argentina," the president stated, according to two of the meeting's participants. The Argentine question was raised by the president of the Swedish Trade Council, Ulf Dinkenspiel. He said he believed that the risk of contagion in the region has been overcome, but he asked President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was in Argentina before traveling to Europe, for a more complete evaluation. The Brazilian president said that a solution for Argentina, even over a longer term, is not a sure thing, due to the institutional risk.

 In this week's address to Congress, US Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed the criticisms of President Bush's rhetoric, which emerged after the president pinned the tag "axis of evil" on countries such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea during his State of the Union address. It was surely not just rhetoric. George W. Bush is no master of eloquence and his speeches are extremely well prepared. The president is not a man who likes to improvise. The expression is undoubtedly strong and well thought out. America has not seen such a bellicose president since Ronald Reagan, who, in 1983, referred to the Soviet Union as the "evil empire". In some European capitals there are rumours that Bush is defining his doctrine based on the war against terror but also as an excuse to pursue another unilateral offensive. The USA has proclaimed the right to attack countries which do not cooperate in a campaign that the president has said is taking place between civilization and barbarity. It sounds clumsy to place North Korea, Iran and Iraq in the same axis as if they were Nazi Germany, Hirohito's Japan and Mussolini's Italy. In fact, those three countries do share a hatred for the USA, but why has Saudi Arabia not been included on the same list, since that country has always been a sponsor of Islamic fundamentalism? Colin Powell will have trouble wriggling out of the need to explain and justify the president's vision. The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, a man becoming more powerful by the day, is perfectly at ease with the rhetorical petards hurled by the commander-in-chief. They prove that the USA is gradually adopting an offensive rather than a defensive stance in its strategy. Nevertheless, the White House's offensive also has a domestic dimension. To paint a dark picture of the threats facing the American empire may prove crucial at a time when the government is about to announce its state budget proposals, the cornerstone of which involves one of the largest increases of the last 20 years in the Pentagon's budget. The Democrats continue to close ranks behind the president on the war against terrorism, and to mention an "axis of evil" could help strengthen an atmosphere of national unity that would suit the president when he announces other points in his budget policy with which not everyone might agree. President Bush is insisting on cutting taxation on corporations and the richest Americans, at the same time as money for social programmes is drying up. Bush is launching a new budget deficit era: it would be easier for him to sell his proposals under a period of belt-tightening and national security concerns. The deeper the international crisis, the better for George Bush. Things may even get better for him in the event of the crisis dragging on until 2004, when he will probably try to be re-elected. Until then, it is not certain that the USA will attack Iraq, Iran or North Korea, but the concept of the "axis of evil" will surely be on the president's lips for some time. It concerns a genuine threat but it is a convenient electoral tool too.

 This apparent change of doctrine on Washington's part, following some 20 years of demands -- sometimes successful -- for observance of democratic and constitutional order in Latin America, is laden with threats, in a subcontinent which, during the second half of the last century, experienced a succession of coups d'etat, from Guatemala to Chile, via the Dominican Republican and Argentina, fomented or backed by the CIA and the Pentagon. The fear of lapsing back into the grim years of military dictatorships and revolutionary guerrilla movements has driven virtually all the Latin American countries, with the notable exception of El Salvador, to condemn the overthrow of the constitutional order in Venezuela. Though some of them did not conceal their criticisms of Hugo Chavez, the member countries of the organization of American States (OAS) condemned the coup d'etat and recognized the legitimacy of the elected president.

 In this situation, the "Peace and Security Council," organized by Israel's retired military officers and former high officials of security agencies, launched a movement calling for the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas. As seen in this and other developments, criticisms of Prime Minister Sharon's hard-line military policy against the Palestinians are mounting inside Israel. Eighty percent of the members of the "Peace and Security Council," made up by retired military officers and former high officials of Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence agency, and Shin Bet, its domestic intelligence agency, are demanding that Israel dismantle Jewish "settlements" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, numbering approximately 50; that it unilaterally withdraw its troops from good many areas occupied by them; and that it promptly reopen the peace negotiations with the Palestinians. The fact that, in Israel, former high-ranking figures of the military and of law enforcement and intelligence agencies are getting increasingly critical of Sharon is likely to have a great impact on the situation in the future, according to foreign press comments.

 Kawamura: One of the reasons that the United States has all along not provided Aegis destroyers to Taiwan is that in the past the United States considered Taiwan's armed forces to be the armed forces of the Nationalist Party, not the armed forces of the nation. Nationalization of the armed forces after Lee Teng-hui (Li Teng-hui) and the loyal attitude of the armed forces after Chen Shui-bian (Ch'en Shui-pien) came into office have already gradually allowed the United States to feel at ease. Although Japan and the United States haven't recognized it, in reality, the United States, Japan and Taiwan currently are already situated in a kind of virtual alliance. I reckon that at the last stage, the United States will provide the Aegis destroyer to Taiwan. It is not possible that the Republican Party will get along with China, Taiwan can again wait for a little while.

 According to this expert, the United States is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world. And its total emissions continue to rise. In March, the new Bush Administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the "Kyoto Protocol." Its excuses include that it will harm the US economy and there is insufficient participation by developing nations. Dr. Ren was critical of this irresponsible decision by the US Government. He indicated that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is accumulated over the past 100-200 years. The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission. This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations. Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations. China's per capita emission is only one-sixth that of the United States. It mainly requires the joint effort of industrialized nations to resolve global warming. It is a mistake for the United States to use such an excuse to evade its responsibility.

The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment, and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ---, which has isolated America in an undeniable way. It was due to this isolation that America, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution.

 Sharon would want to describe his aggression as a war. He would want to show the Israelis that they will not be safe unless his army escalates that aggression to a point where the Palestinians would beg for surrender. But judging from how the cycle of violence accelerated in the past few weeks, the war that the former general wants to ignite is not going to come. Instead, he has invented a reality that is much worse than war. It is chaos bordering on a binge of wanton killing that is achieving nothing in political or military terms for either side. What Sharon has succeeded in doing is to radicalize the Palestinians even further.

 The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the "two-isms" in its diplomacy. In the plane collision event, if one goes by the US logic, only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people's doorsteps; the host, on the other hand, does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard. The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side. The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that "US crew members were detained by the Chinese side." It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology. But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members, major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to "retaliate" against China.

 The second conclusion is that, contrary to what some optimists were predicting after 11 September, Bush seems to have decided to stick to a course of arrogant unilateralism when conducting his foreign policy. The break with Kyoto had been a pre-attack marker in the Bush administration, for having demonstrated the latter's absolute indifference to the opinion of even its closest allies, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan. After the World Trade Center and Pentagon tragedies, there were some who thought that Washington's rapprochement with its traditional partners was inevitable, with the goal of defeating the threat of international terrorism.

 There are, however, a couple of problems with this understandable, if knee-jerk, response. First, it assumes that those selected for Guantanamo are connected to the Sept. 11 attacks. Maybe some are (although the world would have a better idea if the U.S., in line with the Geneva Convention, specified just who it was holding). More likely though, the U.S. is using the broadest of brooms to sweep up detainees for Cuba. American intelligence agencies - doubly embarrassed by their failure to foresee the Sept. 11 attack and their inability to locate Usama Bin Ladin - are probably not picky about who they subject to "intense interrogation."

 High-ranking officials of the US administration, including US Vice President Cheney, actively chimed in with his absurd remarks. Inspecting US Air Force bases some time ago, Cheney maintained that the United States would not accept WMD threats. High-ranking officials of the state and defense departments made preposterous remarks, saying that our country is the world's biggest exporter of WMD, ballistic missiles, and relevant technology. This is another diversionary tactic to divert the criticism of people around the world, which was provoked by the fact that Bush had made an announcement on an axis of evil and it had caused a great controversy to the world, to us.

 As the entire world is engaged in handling one of the most serious crises of our time, it is about time that Sharon and his government realise that predatory behaviour will not be tolerated for long. There is an evident international resolve to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its aspects. The calls from Washington and London for the just and legitimate realisation of Palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the Israeli leadership as a guarantee of Israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster.

 Unlike Pakistan, these governments have at least gone to the trouble of finding out how many of their citizens, no matter how misguided, are being held. Human rights groups have also condemned this grave violation of the Geneva Conventions. Islamabad's silence does not set a healthy precedent. The guilt or otherwise of these detainees can be determined only by a competent court. The USA itself admits that one of the possible fates of these prisoners is to stand trial in competent courts in their own countries. If the US is willing to allow their repatriation back home to stand trial under Pakistani laws, why is Pakistan so coy about exercising this option? Incidentally, another 325 Pakistanis are currently rotting in Afghan jails. In this case also, Islamabad is pretending they do not exist. Pakistan has pledged $100 million for Afghan reconstruction. It should at least take up its own citizens' plight with the Karzai administration. Despite the powerful compulsions it is apparently labouring under, Islamabad should at least seek details of the Pakistanis being held at Guantanamo Bay, so that their cases can be taken up with Washington later. A proactive approach, for once, is called for.

 A strong case can be made for change in the American foreign policy at the grassroots level. However, like any other legitimate message, it costs money, sustained effort, and organisation to put it out. The Arab and Muslim communities in the United States have made a great progress without considerable support from the Arab and Muslim governments. I believe much more can be accomplished if closer attention is paid to the potential for change from within America. Supporting our schools and community centres is a good starting point.

 It is hard not to see a desire for revenge in cages which recall 'Hotel Hanoi', set up by the North Vietnamese, or the punishment cells in Japanese camps in the 'Bridge on the River Kawi.' Even its most loyal ally, Great Britian, is showing signs of disquiet in the statements made by its members of parliament, and in the reports carried by its media. The BBC has been posing questions about those photos which "are stirring up protests," and many people believe them to be "a scandal": photos taken in part at the landing of the C17s after the trip from Afghanistan, which already showed the prisoners reduced to objects, with gags, masked goggles, and ear muffs. "Those people were ready to gnaw through the cables of the C17 to make it crash," said Richard Myers, the Chief of Staff. "They are pictures which do not represent everyday life at the camp. They wore the muffs and the goggles during the trip. And the masks are to prevent tuberculosis from spreading," assured the commander of X-Ray, Brigadier General Mike Lehnert. But the head of the medical staff of Amnesty International, Jim West, has claimed that "there is no other explanation for these measures than the attempt to degrade the human condition." "I am shocked -- he said -- because they still wear the ear muffs and the goggles inside the camp. As for the hospital masks, it is highly unlikely that tuberculosis can spread in open places." Other human rights groups have talked in terms of "sensory segregation,'" "In that condition, you suffer from hallucinations," stated Helen Bamber, from the Medical Foundation for Protecting Victims of Torture, on television. Four envoys from the Red Cross arrived Saturday, and will talk with the prisoners. But 'torture' is a word which is now filtering through in insidious fashion.

 Vladimir Putin's visit to the Khrunichev center proved to be not only instructive but also very pleasant for the Russian president. Unlike the vast majority of the former giants of Russian industry, the center is an entirely successful enterprise now too. It is one of the most successful space-rocket firms not only by Russian criteria but by world ones too. The size of the center's hard-currency earnings since its foundation in 1993 is nearing $2 billion on commercial space-device launches alone and the center's annual budget exceeds three billion rubles. The Proton family of rockets the Khrunichev center produces is one of the most popular commodities on the international market for the launch of heavy carriers. The center is responsible for implementing the main programs connected with Russia's participation in the International Space Station (ISS) project.

 The more fundamental problem, though, has to do with logic. Is the war on terrorism a war or is it not? Many (including me) saw the attacks on New York as a monstrous criminal outrage, rather than an act of war. But President George W. Bush determined otherwise. By treating Sept. 11 as war, Bush was able to call into play the right of self-defence mandated by the United Nations. But if Sept. 11 was an act of war, then it becomes, in a weird way, less monstrous. Both New York City and the Pentagon are legitimate wartime targets - the former economic, the latter military. Anyone waging war on the U.S. would have targeted Manhattan in the hope of damaging the American economy - as the World Trade Center attack did.

 Venezuela's economic situation forms a wretched background for the ideological experiments of the Bolivarian Constitution that Chavez got approved by plebiscite. The worst recession in recent decades has been alleviated only by the recent increase in petroleum prices. Eight hundred firms have closed their doors. Half the active population is in the informal economy. All of that stands in brutal contrast to the 1970's, the decade of the petroleum boom, when Andres Perez was the "socialist Little Father." Over $200 billion in royalties was squandered with no benefit at all for the population. When the price of petroleum fell the first time, the Venezuelan economy went down the drain.

 For every effect, there is a cause. After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects. Take one example. To the United States, Iraq's Saddam Regime is a thorn in the eye and flesh which must be removed. But Chavez in his 2000 visit to some OPEC member states made a stop at Baghdad where he held talks with Saddam. In addition, while the United States is disgusted with the Cuban Government under Castro, the Chavez Government has kept a close relationship with the Cuban Government. Probably this is the major reason why the United States is happy to see a change of government in Venezuela.

The independence of Zimbabwe's justice system was compromised. The local press was harassed.

The real secret of the ballot box will never be revealed.

 There are several models today, and they answer the question of why the climate is changing with varying degrees of persuasiveness. Why don't I have the sense that the models explain everything? The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system. But to what extent does this reflect real life? Nevertheless, the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous. Our institute, along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center, has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development. There are no results to speak of yet, but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared.

He was as good as his word.

 Something similar is said regarding Israel's fight against the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups. Figures are cited: last year 200 individuals died at the hands of terrorists, and more than 1,500 were injured. Officially Israel recognizes the Palestinians' rights to their lands in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River, but it is conducting a war without rules, "utilizing force in an inappropriate volume." Although, of course, these super-rigid activities are to a great extent warranted, the State Department notes. Incidentally, the State Department does not consider Russia's involvement in the antiterrorist campaign a "mitigating factor."

Moscow, May 8, IRNA -- Deputy head of the Russian Geopolitical Research Institute Lyonid Ivashev said on Wednesday the United States sees part of an axis of evil any country which does not follow the its policies. Talking to IRNA, Ivashev expressed regrets over the fact that the people in some parts of the world are indifferent toward the expansionist policies of the United States and do not proceed to condemn them. He strongly criticized the US war-mongering actions and tactics and said the US war-mongering has posed serious threats to the world. He said the United States has turned into an axis of evil itself and is ignoring even the resolutions issued by the United Nations. Ivashev further said Russia is to develop its relations with the Muslim nations as well as China and India. He said there are deep differences between Russia and the United Stats on a range of strategic, political and economic issues. He said the US officials claim as for the countries described as "parts of an axis of evil" are "unfounded" and the US claims in this connection are "sheer lies". Reacting to the threats launched by the US president George W. Bush against Iran he condemned the United States expansionist policies. US President George W. Bush had in his State of the Union address termed Iran, Iraq and North Korea as "axis of evil" and accused them of attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction. Ivashev further said the United States is after gaining superiority over Russia's nuclear capabilities and initiating an anti-missile defense system by the United States shows that country's intentions. He said the United States is after imposing its expansionists policies under the pretext of the fight against terrorism.

 Perhaps it is perverse to have rules for warfare. But the world is a perverse place. And so, since the late 19th century, most nations that call themselves civilized have adhered to such rules. The 1949 Geneva Convention specifies that any belligerents captured in the course of war - be they regular soldiers, militia members or volunteers "operating in or outside their territory even if this territory is occupied" - must be accorded prisoner of war status. The convention exempts only those, such as spies and saboteurs, who do not clearly identify themselves as belligerents. But clearly it was meant to apply to the Taliban and Al Qa'ida fighters captured after vicious battles in Afghanistan, fighters who made no secret of who they were, what they were supporting and who they thought their enemies were.

 Moscow, 24 March: Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is departing for Mongolia on Sunday afternoon [25 March] on an official visit, the premier's press secretary, Tatyana Razbash, told ITAR-TASS. The official programme of Kasyanov's stay in capital Ulaanbaatar will begin with a tete-a-tete meeting with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enhbayar on Monday, followed by talks in an extended format and signing of several agreements. Besides this, the Russian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Mongolian President Natsagiyn Bagabandi and the parliamentary speaker, Sanzhbegiyn Tumur-Ochir. On Tuesday, 26 March, Kasyanov will address Russian and Mongolian entrepreneurs and visit Science and Technology University. He is also expected to be awarded the title of honorary doctor of the university. On Tuesday night, Kasyanov will wind up his Mongolian tour and leave for Vietnam for an official visit. The turnover of goods between Russia and Mongolia has reached 240m dollars. Russia exports petroleum products, electricity, machinery and equipment to Mongolia and imports copper concentrate and meat. Moscow has expressed the wish to import more Mongolian meat. Russia's Ambassador to Mongolia Oleg Derkovskiy believes that there are no problems in relations between the two states and the common border stretching for 3,500 kilometres is a border of peace and good neighbourliness. Moscow and Ulaanbaatar are continuing a political dialogue, actively developing bilateral trade, and consulting each other on international problems where their stands coincide or are close. At the same time, the ambassador said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that large Russian capital and businesses "are not active enough in dealings with Mongolia" at the moment.

 Accordingly, Russia has joined the anti-terrorist coalition of the United States virtually without reservation. Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side. He wanted to become an ally, and that's what he has become. But making this complex decision was not easy for him. Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of "the rare opportunity for (Russia) to become integrated with the civilized world." But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America, the country that has been historically responsible for "educating" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan. In the end, a certain consideration that differed from the above two proved to be decisive. It had to do with Chechnya. Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of "international terror." He did not succeed with that so far. He was criticized more than recognized for his policy. At this time however, he taught a lesson to the Americans. After the Americans had promised everything good and nice, Putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in Chechnia "could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism." In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way. Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington, namely, that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents. Nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to "unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups," and that they accept Putin's offer to make peace. If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind "Chechen terrorism," we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views.

 To form an "axis," it is imperative to form an alliance, but there is no alliance whatsoever among Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK.

 Addressing Friday worshippers gathered at Tehran University, Iran's former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday criticized the treatment of Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in Guantanamo military base in Cuba. The former president and current chairman of the Expediency Council said that these prisoners are put in chain, in cages in summer and in winter. He said that the Americans are treating these prisoners like "an ostrich". They neither believe that these prisoners are truly prisoners, nor do they believe that they are "captives." After pointing its finger of blame at tens of regimes and governments around the world for decades. Washington needs to review its own history of crimes against humanity, especially the non-WASP humanity. What is non-WASP humanity? Non-White Anglo-Saxon-Protestant humanity is that part of humanity whose eyes are not bluest of the blue and whose hair is not blondest of the blonde. According to Americans, this sort of humanity does not qualify for any of the laws that have been legislated by international organizations, by any accepted world conventions. (John Walker, "the American Taleban" has not been taken to Guantanamo because he is not part of the non-WASP humanity). The treatment of Al-Qa'idah and Taleban prisoners will go down in history as the most shameful detentions in the history of post-war incarceration in the 21st century. The US President George W. Bush has said that he does not recognize the detainees in Guantanamo military base as war captives, and hence he will not accord them the rights and privileges that they would automatically get under Geneva Convention. The argument by Bush is that these detainees are members of a terrorist group and hence they do not qualify as members of a defeated country or an army. Even if we assume that George W. Bush has a point in making this argument, it is not up to him to decide who is a captive or who is not a captive. An international tribunal consisting of experts on international law should decide on this issue, not Mr. Bush whose knowledge of international law leaves plenty to be desired. The world is watching how the US is treating the detainees in Guantanamo. The world well remembers how the United States has been calling other countries as violators of human rights, while it has been involved in one of the grossest type of human rights violations. The case of the United States is like the case of that pot who called the kettle black. If the United States is truly committed to human rights, it should show it in its treatment of the detainees that it has transported in chain to another side of the globe. This is in no way defending the Taleban or the Al-Qa'idah members, some of whom might be guilty of the most heinous crimes against the poor oppressed people in Afghanistan. The point is that if the United States keeps pontificating and preaching about human rights, it can't suddenly forget about its past lectures to other countries and nations. [end]

The fight against the new, transnational terrorism requires an exceptionally broad and committed strategy. But to build this strategy, targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary.

North Norway will also get more precipitation in the fall but warmer temperatures in the winter. In the eastern part of Norway the biggest increase in precipitation will be in the winter. In coming years the winters will be less snowy but greener and wetter.

 The US President preferred a more realistic attitude, because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in one decade. What is also realistic is the idea that it will be easier to persuade the main polluting agents to take measures by providing incentives to them, rather than by constraint. No matter how cynical this may appear, the US administration is mainly concerned with getting out of the recession and with relaunching the economy, rather than with the greenhouse effect.

 In this sort of crisis there can never be just one guilty party. The government is also paying the price for its delays in putting together a plan in the wake of its electoral defeat, with interest payments on the public debt maturing very soon as well. It was also quite naive to think that Peronism would readily reach an agreement with a defeated administration. The new federal pact will necessarily mean that those who won the elections will have to give up funding.

 Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: "battlefield prisoners."

 It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about "good governance" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on "sustainable development" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end.

 What raises even more questions is the order that President Bush issued last November. Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another. Only special military commissions can try them. It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence. Consequently, evidence will be accepted that "a normal person" deems to have the value of evidence. Hence guilt need not be established "beyond reasonable doubt," nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence. Appeal is not possible, but the death penalty is. On the other hand, US Taliban or al-Qa'ida fighters, such as the recently captured John Walker Lindh, will be tried by ordinary US criminal courts.

 An outbreak of a highly contagious type of tuberculosis has been reported in Embu [central Kenya]. Health authorities said yesterday that more than 27 people had tested positive for the severe sputum smear type of tuberculosis. A TB expert, Dr Joel Kangangi, said one person infected with the bacteria could spread it to more than 10 people in a day. The doctor, however, said no deaths had been reported. The worst affected areas are Dallas, Majengo and the Shauri Yako slums with a population of 17,000 people. Dr Kangangi, an assistant director of medical services attached to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme, said 56 per cent of those infected with TB were also HIV-positive. Health personnel have been deployed to the affected areas to carry out random screening of residents to contain the outbreak. Yesterday, Dr Kangangi carried out random checks on hundreds of residents in Dallas estate. He was accompanied by the Embu Medical Officer of Health, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, and a team of health personnel. The medic blamed the outbreak on congestion in the slums and failure to observe basic hygienic practices. The residents are being advised to ensure that their houses were well ventilated to avoid multiplication of germs. They are also being advised to seek medical attention immediately they detect symptoms of the disease. The symptoms include prolonged cough, chest pains, fever and loss of weight and appetite.

The US stance, however, makes the dialogue impossible. This remark also infringes on Russia's interests. Bush's dogma astonished the world. By publicly designating countries and their peoples, not some terrorist elements or organizations, enemies of mankind, the United States is taking the risk of confronting itself with all the other countries in the world.

 First paradox: The Argentine economy is not very open, not even to its neighbors in Latin America. Its exports amount to just 8 percent of its GDP, as do its imports. The result is a trade balance, in marked contrast to a balance of payments deficit burdened by servicing its debt. Other countries live on a currency board system, most notably Hong Kong. But this Chinese territory has an extremely open economy, to the point where its exports exceed its GDP, thereby facilitating the influx of foreign currency.

The expert immediately sketched on a blackboard what this should look like, mixing up chemical symbols: rockets would carry metallic sodium into orbits around the earth. Cooling aerosols dispersed over the polar zones would prevent overheating of the tundra during sunny summer nights.

 In his fellow countrymen's eyes, the test constituted by 11 September has revealed George Bush's talents as a war leader. He is clearly more comfortable in this role than he is in he management of routine matters. His force of conviction when he preaches the struggle of good against evil largely explains his exceptional popularity ratings (83 percent of favorable opinions, according to the latest ABC and Washington Post surveys.) So on Tuesday evening George Bush tried to reproduce the tone of his 20 September speech in order to galvanize the country. "The United States will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the most destructive weapons. Whatever the cost of our country's defense, we will pay it. The evil is real, and it must be combated... even in the midst of tragedy, specially in the midst of tragedy, God is there..."

 It is clear that the proposals for US action on climate change are domestic. But the EU is concerned that they will not even be sufficient to reduce US emissions. The "intensity target" proposed allows for further increases in absolute emissions and is not sufficient to effectively fight climate change. On the contrary, the Kyoto Protocol requires most industrialised countries to achieve absolute emission reductions, while they still foresee to have growing economies.

 The final switch to the dollar would stabilize relations between creditors and debtors. But it would also be a very painful way of restoring credibility, "like when one loses one's virginity and the only solution is to enter a convent," as one monetary expert put it. But neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an "Argentine risk." Plus there is the problem of external competitiveness that remains unsolved. Unless the peso is devalued before it disappears, that is technically possible but more delicate when it comes to credibility.

Today the Council of EU environment ministers adopted the Commission's proposal for a decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The European Commission strongly welcomes this decision. By taking this decision, the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing multilateral solutions to issues of global concern. With its decision to ratify the protocol at EU level, the European Union stays true to its ambition to enable the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August/September 2002. The decision also makes the Member States' greenhouse gas reduction commitments (the so-called "Burden-Sharing Agreement") agreed in June 1998 legally binding. The EU continues to call for the United States to participate in the global framework for addressing climate change.

In any event, the oil industry may be asked for an advance on taxes due, as had been under consideration a couple of weeks ago. If any withholding arrangement is implemented, it will apply to all exports, not just some.

 Kawamura: Frankly speaking, Taiwan's navy is worrisome. Anti-submarine combat strength is extremely low, and in particular there are many old style naval aircraft that, compared to Japan, are possibly 30 to 40 years behind. Torpedo strength is also insufficient. The Navy's problems are very large. For example, there is only one submarine attached to each naval base. It can only be said that this is nothing more than an embellishment and fundamentally cannot accomplish anything. Taiwan should make an all out effort to augment naval combat strength. In past Taiwan-US arms sale negotiations, the PC-3 early warning aircraft and the MH53 helicopter that Taiwan has made requests to purchase are entirely suitable to Taiwan's needs. The PC-3's intelligence exchange system is extremely important and is not inferior to the Aegis destroyer.

 Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela. They have pointed out: When will a "coup" not be called a "coup"? It will not be a "coup" so long as the United States thinks it is not! According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms. This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days. When questioned by a reporter "why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America," Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator "may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch."

Islamabad, March 6, IRNA -- Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul on Wednesday rejected this year's US State Department report on human rights, saying it was "a pack of blatant lies and propaganda." A former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Hameed Gul told IRNA in an interview here that each country which resisted American hegemony was deemed a violator of human rights. "In a fit of force, the US wanted to subjugate the entire world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in this direction and the recent report on human rights was also a manifestation of its hegemonistic designs," the lieutenant general (retd) continued. Hameed Gul was of the opinion that the US was the only country in the world that had no respect for any religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights and rules. "It is unprecedented in the history of the comity of nations that the US forcibly wanted to prevent countries from upholding religious and cultural values," he said. "The US is the most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country. The world would never forget the barbarities it committed on the innocent Afghan people, women, children and the elderly," he firmly said. In order to realize its vested interests in the region, he said the US and its allies unleashed oppression against the Afghan people and used latest weaponry against the defenseless nation. In this regard, he made a quick reference to the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims. "Since the rioting erupted last week, over 600 people, mostly Muslims, have been brutally murdered in the hands of extremist Hindus in India, but the US and other so-called civilized nations kept a shameful mum," he remarked. The Americans, he pointed out, see violations of human rights when a country or a group of people become hurdles in the realization of their vested interests. "What Israel is doing in Palestine against the Muslims is also one of the worst examples of rights abuses but the US is again silent, but when Palestinians react to Israeli attacks America is quick to The logical solution to the Palestinian issue is a free and independent state for the people of Palestine as enshrined under UN resolutions, he said. But the US is denying this, he added. He said it clearly means that the Muslims have no right to defend themsleves against their oppressors. "America wants total submission of Muslims across the globe," Hameed Gul said. "The situation requires a concerted moral resistance by Muslims scholars; if they remain indifferent to each other's plight in the hands of imperialist forces led by the US, they would be crushed one by one," he warned. Muslims rulers should forge unity in their ranks to resist the ever-increasing US influence; otherwise, they would be targeted one by one, Hameed Gul concluded.

 Vladimir Putin was insistently asked to tackle another of Russia's space problems yesterday. According to Rosaviakosmos Head Yuriy Koptev, he and his colleagues had "informed the president" of their wish that the program for the development of the Plesetsk space center be given federal status. In the future, Russia is planning to gradually transfer all launches from Kazakhstan's Baykonur onto its own territory. This is connected both with considerations of economy ($115 million has to be paid every year just to lease Baykonur) and with the problem of the country's "space sovereignty": After all it is only possible to guarantee to ensure the launches of commercial devices from your own territory. Incidentally, the president was reminded about "space sovereignty" on Monday before his visit to the center. During the talks with his Turkmen colleague that took place immediately before it, the head of state had to discuss an agreement to pay Ashgabat financial compensation for the use of so-called "fall sites": Three Turkmen regions (with a total area of over one million hectares) on which the spent rocket stages fall after being launched from Baykonur (the stipulated size of payment for a single use of the regions comes to around $70,000).

 During a general warming, completely opposite phenomena take place. In the polar regions, climate changes are more pronounced than in the middle latitudes. As a result, the temperature doesn't change much in the equatorial and middle latitudes but changes a great deal in the polar regions. What does this lead to? Dispersion is less active, and so-called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often. We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia. Incidentally, last year's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property. Because, strange as it may seem, prolonged, stagnant cold spells are also a result of global warming when there is less ventilation of the atmosphere as a whole.

 Second paradox: The self-proclaimed parity between the peso and the dollar never enabled the government and even less private borrowers to obtain credit terms to match those enjoyed by the Americans. The risk premium has always been considerable, rates never falling below 10 percent. This places an unbearable burden on the government in servicing the debt and a revenue to match for the creditors. Argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: No less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the Argentines themselves.

 A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors. As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth. Benchmarking guarantees only that companies belong to the top of their class, but says nothing about that class's performance as compared with the whole universe.

 But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation. Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict. The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population. Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part.

 To be more precise, prisoners of war are not to be treated like those jailed by the U.S. at its Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Those detainees, brought shackled, shaved and blindfolded to Cuba, are kept in chain link pens under the constant glare, night and day, of halogen lamps. (The blindfolding, deliberate disorientation, discomfort and constant light are staples of police states all over the world. The idea is to break down the inmate, weaken him from lack of sleep and thereby make him more pliable when the interrogators begin their serious work). Washington is brazen about its flouting of international law, secure in the knowledge that neither its citizens not its allies will complain. Indeed, many Americans (and some Canadians) probably think anyone connected to the Sept. 11 terror attacks deserves whatever he gets.

So an edifying photograph, or viewed as such, but one which, the explanation is, in fact is deceiving: the prisoners were reportedly photographed shortly after their arrival, that is, if one understands this correctly, they were shackled and blinded as they had been during the 27-hour trip from Afghanistan to Cuba. But, however, they were under medical supervision, their heads shaved, and enjoying hygienic and food conditions that were very superior to what they could have known in Afghanistan.

 Washington, March 4 (Yonhap) -- The U.S. State Department published its annual human rights country report Monday, reconfirming poor human rights conditions in North Korea. The "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001," submitted to Congress, said North Korea's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. It also estimated that anywhere from several hundreds of thousands to two million people died from starvation and related diseases. Other human rights abuses in the North included extrajudicial executions and disappearances. "Citizens are detained arbitrarily, and many are held as political prisoners and prison conditions are harsh. The constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary and fair trials are not implemented in practice," the report said. On the other hand, the report described South Korea as "generally respecting the human rights of its citizens" although problems remain in some areas. The report pointed out as "remaining problems" in South Korea, police's physical or verbal abuses of detainees at times and the National Security Law (NSL)'s infringement upon free expression and other civil liberties. Other problems cited in the report include domestic violence, rape, child abuse, legal and societal discrimination against women and ethnic minorities. In particular, trafficking in persons was a problem. South Korea was cited in the report as a "major transit point for alien smugglers, including traffickers of primarily Asian women and children for the sex trade and domestic servitude." The report, however, noted the government has taken various steps to improve its human rights record. It also noted President Kim Dae-jung stated repeatedly that promoting the rights of women was a priority goal. In connection with freedom of speech and press, the report said the Seoul government abandoned direct control over the news media, but it continues to exercise indirect influence, and government officials vigorously lobby reporters and editors. It cited controversial massive tax probes of media firms which critics accused of being an attempt to curb media criticism of the government while the government maintained the tax audit was a legitimate activity and long overdue. Meanwhile, the report called Afghanistan "a triumph for human rights in 2001," saying that after the U.S.-led war on terrorism, Afghan citizens have been released from the brutal and oppressive rule of the Taliban and Afghan women, who suffered violence and repression, are now beginning to resume their roles in society. The report also noted improvement in human rights records in such countries as Bahrain, Peru, Qatar and Oman. cjs2001@yna.co.kr

 The EU's efforts and US President Bush's peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution, considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia's heir to the throne, Prince Abdullah, which contained two points: recognition of a Palestinian state [as published] in an Arab neighborhood, in return for recognition of the Palestinians' right to their own country. Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan, demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab. In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine, labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers.

 In order to compete with the United States, Europe, and China, Japan decided to drastically reduce its costs, especially in every aspect of rocket design and manufacture. It adopted the simplest design and implemented various cost-cutting measures in an attempt to lower the manufacturing cost per satellite from 19 billion yen to 9 billion yen. It is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable. However, things did not go according to plan. This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures. In November 1999, a "multi-purpose" satellite was launched by H2 rocket No. 8. It did not enter its predetermined orbit and had to be destroyed. This was the third failure in a row. After this incident, Japan began to redesign the main engine of the H2 rocket. Eventually, the H2A rocket was developed.

 The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution. Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and, more exactly, they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago. This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of "divide and rule." It actually reflects Israel's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole. The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities. The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence. The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities. Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception.

You can never be too sure about what you are communicating. Such could be the lesson drawn by the Pentagon and the White House from the hue and cry that has been provoked in the world by the release of the now famous photographs of blinded, gagged, chained, and kneeling prisoners in their enclosure at the Guantanamo camp. At the end of a brilliantly waged and very carefully framed war, punctuated by briefings that had brought Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, a veritable media triumph, there was this one image too many.

 Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too, neither Russia, China, Japan, nor even the European Union, had shown any enthusiasm; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project. Concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth's climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] Bonn Conference, America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Whereas, beforehand, it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well. Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America, European Union, and Russia and China. And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict, and until the rivalry persists, the question would continue to remain unresolved.

 We hope that the United States will come to realize that an active climate protection policy is not only necessary for environmental policy but is also an excellent opportunity to modernize industrial society. The Kyoto Protocol is a first major step. It should therefore be implemented as quickly as possible and extended beyond the initial period of 2008-2012. The return of the United States to the system must remain our goal. The door remains wide open for the United States to return to the Kyoto process: The biggest emitter of greenhouse gases cannot be relieved of its responsibilities for global climate protection.
