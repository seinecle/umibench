 In all likelihood, President Bush made that statement on 18 January following a consultation -- which was "rather brief," some US observers believe -- with Ashcroft, who was strongly supported by Cheney. Obviously, this decision simplified things, and it allowed the US judiciary to conduct the investigation of the 158 detainees as it sees fit. The United States wanted this very much, because so far the identity and citizenship of those they call "terrorists" (or "killers" in Bush's languages without nuances) rather than prisoners in a conventional war have not been published for reasons that are easy to understand. According to information circulated by the main US newspapers, the detainees are citizens of 25 countries, including England, France, Australia, Yemen, Algeria, and even Sweden (!). Saudi Arabia alone says "more than 100" of the 158 are Saudi citizens (a figure the Americans see as exaggerated), and Saudi Interior Minister Prince Saud Nayif recently said that his country would like to have them repatriated, to be tried at home.

 Like any form of state terrorism, it is above all contradictory. Yesterday, Yasser Arafat was being asked to police the area he was supposed to be in charge of, while destroying the instruments of his power. Today, he is being completely isolated and the desire to drive him away is scarcely disguised.

 This is the first time in war history that "terrorists" have become war prisoners. While the international community does not have any universally acknowledged definition for "terrorist," there is also not any established provision in international law for assessing the punishments for "terrorists." In particular, there is not any precedence to be used as reference.

 It is only natural, with the guerilla operations successively occur, even inside the fortified settlements, that the world begins to wonder whether the accusations that Arafat was planning, and instructing attacks on Israeli targets despite his captivity, and the round-the-clock Israeli surveillance, were founded. The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology.

 What holds true with regard to threats by EU leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain European states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing.

 For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

 The third big challenge concerns land use: a change in the way land and forests are used so as to prevent the inclusion of activities that do not lead to a real reduction in emissions.

 Western nations and US allies, for the first time ever, took such a concerted stance critical of Washington.

Inside the United States itself, too, there were widespread debates against the Bush gaffe.

 The protocol faced danger of being shelved altogether, when the U.S, which is responsible for one-fourth of all CO2 emissions in the world, decided to abruptly withdraw from the climate change treaty last March. The Bush administration fears the treaty will have a negative effect on its economy and maintains that developing countries, such as China and India, should also be subject to mandatory emission targets.

 The commitment to liberalism, the second strand of the Menem program, lived up to its promises. Privatization earned $40 billion. Its success established the reputation of Buenos Aires on international markets. The real gauge of this confidence was the size of the national debt, that grew and grew. It more than doubled during the 1990s, from $60 billion to $132 or even $150 in 2001, making Argentina the number one market borrower among the emerging economies.

 These are not abstract questions. Countries sign on to the Geneva Convention not to be altruistic but to ensure that their own soldiers will be well treated if captured.

 Argentina has none of these worthy arguments. Yet, over the past ten years, it has done everything it can to be considered one of the IMF's good pupils. The government adopted a fixed parity between the dollar and the peso in 1991 in order to stop unrestricted inflation. Buenos Aires privatized, on Washington's recommendation, all of its public companies. The government, without assets to sell and without the possibility of falling back on the devaluation of its currency, is now condemned to keep on asking for foreign capital to maintain its balance of payments in equilibrium. Hence, a foreign debt of $130 billion and the urgent need for an inflow of capital from the IMF to repay $2 billion in debt that is coming due on 19 December. In the event of non-payment, the country will find itself an outcast of the international financial community.

US envoy retired General Anthony Zinni is to arrive in the region under circumstances similar to those that surrounded his first visit to Palestine and Israel. The Israeli Government works to abort his mission in advance by storming Palestinian territories, assassinating citizens it alleges have links to security activities, and arresting innocent citizens. The only change is that the Israeli authorities have denied any link between a number of Palestinian martyrs and prisoners on one hand and the armed organizations on the other, saying they were mere unarmed citizens, who were accidentally present near regular Israeli targets.

 The outflows forced some banks to ask the government to set limits. Cavallo could think of nothing better than the curbs on withdrawals.

 Hence you can hardly speak of a "targeting error" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft.

 These facts are well understood by the US Administration as human rights violations take place every day. The United States has been preparing annual reports on human rights in 190 countries for 25 years while ignoring the real situation at home.

 Since 1997, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has frequently interacted with other world leaders to overcome obstacles and open up paths to negotiation. A formidable deadlock occurred, however, at the meeting in The Hague at the end of 2000, and it seriously threatened the protocol's future. At a new meeting in Bonn in July of this year, thanks to the efforts of many delegations, including that from Brazil, which played a leading role, it was possible to isolate five areas for negotiation.

 "This is the minimum that has to be done. Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming," comments one high-ranking member of the Brazilian Government. Alone, and under the command of a president who managed to create a strong political coalition explained only by his own survival instinct, Argentines will be unable to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability. How does this affect Brazil? To answer a question of this nature, the Brazilian Foreign Minister would surely resort to Ortega y Gasset: "I am I and my circumstances. If I do not save them, I do not save myself."

 The European initiative will serve as a test of not only Israel's intentions toward the peace process that are known for being negative, but also as a test of the US stand.

 Israel's attack on Arafat's headquarters deals a stinging slap on the face of ongoing Arab efforts to negotiate a political settlement to the ongoing conflict. The just-concluded Arab summit had unanimously adopted a Saudi peace initiative, which called for full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory occupied in the 1967 war, the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and a "fair solution" to the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN resolutions. In return, the Arabs had agreed to consider that the Arab-Israeli conflict is at an end, enter into peace treaties with Israel and open normal relations in the context of this comprehensive peace. Israel's immediate response to the peace plan was to dismiss it as a non-starter. The attack on the PA headquarters barely a day after the peace initiative was accepted by the Arabs clearly indicates Israel's rejection of any efforts to negotiate peace through compromise. It has been clear for some time that the Sharon government is planning on settling issues with the Palestinians through invasion and re-occupation of Palestinian land and then offering a settlement based on its terms. As events over the past two years indicate, a strategy based on imposing a settlement through military means will only deepen anger and provoke retaliatory violence from the Palestinians. The attack on the PA headquarters is an explosive move and has put West Asia on the brink of another war. The international community must act immediately to pressure the Israeli government to step back from the dangerous course of action it is determined to pursue.

 To add a country like Argentina to this list of problems is to allow the growth of a dangerous focus of social dissatisfaction, which is tending to express itself outside of any institutional control. Argentine society is divorcing itself from political parties and national institutions, and it is in such an environment that radical responses germinate, such as authoritarian regimes and the formation of guerrilla groups.

 For the moment Mr. Bush simply proposes to curb the increase in harmful gas emissions and is counting on the good will of US industrialists, who account for 36% of the greenhouse gas produced by industrialized countries (as opposed to 31.6% for Europe).

 Soon after the World Trade Centre attacks, we started to witness the beginning of a concerted effort by the Bush administration and the media to cast Arabs and Muslims as the new enemy of America. The campaign has been successful so far, and has not been seriously challenged by Arab and Muslim Americans who have been struggling to merely distance themselves from terrorism. The early signs of the newly-shaped American perception of their conflict with Arabs and Muslims have started to surface. Complete disregard for the plight of the Palestinians despite timid warnings to Israel to show restraint is indicative of the new political perspective.

 The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies.

Incidentally, the riots also occurred following the IMF's announcement of Argentina's debts.

For its own reasons, which are linked to its interests and, naturally, to Israel's interests, the United States chose to put intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority. It wanted the PA to meet difficult, even impossible, security conditions. It also tried, through this pressure, to remove the legitimacy of the PA and its chairman Yasir Arafat under the pretext of terrorism or support for terrorism. This US position, which is fully biased to Israel, strengthened Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's attempts to suppress national Palestinian ambitions and achieve his declared objective of establishing Israeli security on the rubble of the legitimate Palestinian rights.

The U.S. government says that the terrorist attack on New York City was an act of war. Yet it refuses to treat those it has captured in the course of this war as prisoners of war. Instead, it refers to them as "unlawful combatants" not entitled to the protection of the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the U.S. signed and which sets out rules for treating enemy soldiers. It shackles them, houses them in unprotected chain link compounds (in Cuba, of all places) and threatens "intense interrogation."

 The conclusion to be reached from this whole picture is that under the current constitutional and legal framework for the holding of presidential elections, it is almost impossible to vote out an incumbent President.

 The ill effects of the Argentine crisis can contaminate the nearest countries first, like Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia.

 The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East. Maybe Joschka Fischer's plan for suspending Germany's military aid for Israel, that is, possible EU economic sanctions against Tel Aviv is honorable, but it is a late and disturbingly long-term plan. Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, and the Palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state.

 At present, very few in the international community have responded in favor of the theory of "evil axis," because many countries, including China, have made clear their stand against willful expansion of the war against terror. The other day, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov said: "It is unacceptable to Russia to mechanically extend the scope of antiterrorist action to any country, including Iraq." Furthermore, the Russian side has stressed time and time again that the United States' accusations against Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK should be settled within the UN framework and raised objections to any hostile action against these three countries without authorization from the Security Council. In fact, even the US ally, Britain, and other Western countries have indicated that the antiterrorist military action should be conducted with restraint, for otherwise the danger of losing control will emerge. It seems that the market for the theory of "evil axis" is still limited.

 US reticence is not therefore a reason for us to reduce our climate protection efforts. The dominant role of the European climate protection policy has benefits for our economy.

By implementing our European and national climate protection programs we will succeed in creating several hundred thousand new jobs by 2010.

From the vantage point of Latin America and the Caribbean, there can be no doubt about the United States' complicity with the military and civilian authors of the abortive coup d'etat against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. From Mexico to Buenos Aires, television viewers saw, on the Spanish CNN and Telemundo channels, the undisguised pleasure displayed by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the announcement of Hugo Chavez's "resignation," which he never in fact signed. Far from condemning that which the United States at no time described as a coup d'etat, President Bush's spokesman explained that Chavez had indeed brought it on himself and that he bore the responsibility for the "confused events," having violated human rights.

 Appeals were already made to the creditors during the first phase of the debt rescheduling involving the $55 billion held by Argentine funds and that was completed at the end of November. And they will come under pressure again: The IMF's recent refusal to approve a $1.3 billion loan is designed specifically to help Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo put pressure on private investors, as the latter have clearly understood even if not always the observers. At the same time private debtors who became indebted in a strong currency would find themselves ruined by a peso devaluation. This is why dollarization has generated such support among politicians: From former President Carlos Menem, today leader of the most influential Peronist faction, to new Finance Secretary Miguel Kiguel, a former banker, charged along with Domingo Cavallo with restoring order to public finances.

 The question now is: Did the White House lie? If it turns out to be true that the two US colonels were involved in the failed attempt, there can be no other conclusion. The two colonels would not have been acting on their own. They must have been under orders -- orders stretching all the way back to the Oval Office. This spells serious trouble for Bush. The whiff of scandal and conspiracy is in the air -- and the American media, ever addicted to conspiracy theories, is not going to let it go. It -- and the opposition Democrats, still smarting at his election victory -- will dig for dirt as long it takes. Even if it finally turns out that the two colonels were operating without the knowledge and approval of the White House, it will be a disaster for Bush. Americans will want to know who exactly is running their country.

 Amidst the heat of military battles in Afghanistan, and on the background of the double crime that hit the United States, international opinion is now willing to overlook some inhumane practices that were made on this or that front. However, the situation has changed fundamentally since the batches of Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners started arriving one after the other to Guatanamo base shackled and caged in cages that are no longer than eight feet and wider than six. The attention of the world moved from Afghanistan to Cuba to follow what Amnesty International considers an "uncomfortable situation" for the detainees. This has prompted two of Washington's closest allies, Britain and Australia, to express their "concern" over the way the prisoners were transported from Afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity.

 With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice. This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark. And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday. Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit.

 The Americans are issuing denials, saying "There is no inhumane treatment, and we are open, as far as possible, to the suggestions of the Red Cross." As for the rest, they are raising the objection of reason of State, and an emergency which is definitely not over: Since September 11, 1,500 suspected terrorists have been captured in 50 countries, but the intelligence services claim that at least 10,000 affiliates of al-Qa'ida are still scattered across the world, "their network all around us." The inmates at 'Gitmo' must confess, and serve as a warning to their comrades who are still free: This is the unpleasant truth. The status of prisoners of war (which, by law, ought not to be decided on by Rumsfeld, but by a tribunal) would protect them from interrogation, and would guarantee that they get a trial, by court martial, that was much fairer than that of the secret special tribunals which Bush is trying to set up. "Our system will in any event be much fairer than that of the!

 On 18 November, the following day Israel began withdrawing its troops from Tulkarm, Israeli troops deliberately gunned down two Palestinians in the Palestinian autonomous areas as if they were quarries.

As a result, the situation has become tense again.

 Sharon is a master of escalation. He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis. It is likely that at present Sharon is entertaining similar thoughts and wants to create step by step a situation that will make it possible for him to rid himself of his enemy. 
----
 There is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the Americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the "good cause." There is no doubt that a military operation and intensified security measures were imperative after the terrible tragedy of 11 September. That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known. However, the ends -- dealing with those opponents -- does not justify all the means. 
----
If keeping Arafat captive, under siege with the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupying forces, is an affront to Palestinian, Arab dignity, and International justice, it is also a powder keg that will at one point explode, devastating what remains of the Israeli security. It is that same security that Sharon, the assassin, uses as an excuse to instigate struggles and wars, and promote instability. He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance.

 In any event, it is more than apparent that the United States intends to play a conspicuous role and exert increasing pressure as far as the oil issue is concerned. It seems that by wielding its authority and exercising dictatorial powers as the world's only superpower, the United States is determined to play a front and centre role in the intricate international game of oil prices and the free flow of this all-important strategic product otherwise known as the "Black Gold". The fall of Hugo Chavez in Caracas is a crystal-clear message and warning by the US to anyone in the world who is contemplating to use oil as a political tool in the future.

 The promotion of "gradual Taiwan independence" by the leader of the Taiwanese authorities is from his misjudgment of two situations: the internal situation and the external situation. Internally, he considers the "legislative" election last year as the public's recognition to his idea of "Taiwan independence." Support from Lee Teng-hui and overseas "Taiwan independence" forces makes him believe that "the situation is great." In fact, the economic difficulties in the island, the political deadlock, and the public's confidence crisis should be the agenda for the Taiwanese authorities' top concern. Irresponsible promotion of "Taiwan independence" and intensification of cross-strait ties are definitely not blessings to Taiwan. Externally, Sino-US relations are increasingly improving. President Bush will visit China soon. The United States has made a commitment that it will not change its Taiwan policy. But the Taiwanese authorities exaggerated Sino-US conflicts and placed hopes on seeking benefits from such conflicts. This is really an unwise idea.

 Whatever the case, we are entering a difficult period. There is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its "trump card" and commit further acts of terrorism. The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most. The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage. But we had no choice. To have sat back with arms folded would have made us all hostages.

Tehran, April 13, IRNA -- Police in Iran have recently seized 824 kilos of illegal drugs, mostly opium, during a series of operations in which three smugglers were killed and 18 others injured, police officials said Saturday. The biggest seizure, amounting to 697 kilos, was made in the city of Iranshahr in the Sistan Baluchestan province, where four fire arms were also confiscated. The rest of the hauls were made in the provinces of southern Fars and southeastern Khorasan. Meanwhile, a police head said Saturday that some 877 kilos of narcotics had been seized in the south of the Tehran province in the last Iranian year which ended on March 20, 2001. The bulk of the seizures was opium, weighing 534 kilos, besides 118 kilos of hashish plus other drug assortments. Police dismantled 72 gangs of drug traffickers in the period and arrested 12,910 people on drug-related offenses. An official in the southeastern city of Kerman said Saturday that police in the Kerman province had seized 100 kilos of morphine from drug traffickers in recent days. Iran accounts for 80 percent of the opium and 90 percent of the morphine intercepted in the world, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. The Islamic Republic has launched a relentless anti-drug campaign since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, in which more than 3,100 policemen have lost their lives. Iran's anti-drug campaign costs the country 800 million dollars per year, according to officials. An official said recently that the Iranian police had seized 112 tons of illegal drugs and arrested 306,000 people on drug-related charges during last Iranian year which ended on March 21, 2001.

 It turns out that in the dictionary used by the United States, the definition of a "democratic regime" is subjected to double standards. In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of "democracy" and "human rights" that the US always likes to dwell on. Other than that, nothing will count.

 The United Nations human rights rapporteur, Maurice Copithorne, on Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran. Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic. The UN rapporteur's new report on Iran, which he submitted to the commission on Friday, includes nothing new. In most cases he described the legal punishments like floggings and executions of murderers and major drug traffickers that are applied based on the Shria, or Islamic law as human rights violations. In other cases, he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities. He made such charges despite the fact that women's political, social and cultural participation is not less than that of men. Women in Iran hold managerial, academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet. And as far as minorities are concerned, they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority, as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely. In his report, the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran's internal affairs. For instance, he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran, while the measure has been taken in line with the law. He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations! This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials. Interestingly, although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996, he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic. This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime. Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

 It must be acknowledged that the government of Ariel Sharon has so far taken the opposite tack and that, while he has grudgingly recognized the Palestinians' right to a state, it has been under conditions such that this state, reduced to a series of Bantustans, has no chance of living and developing peacefully. Extremists on both sides have clearly understood this and have derived nothing but encouragement from it.

 Chavez' short but tumultuous time in power, which he achieved by electoral means following a failed mutiny, arouses fears concerning the future of Latin America's oldest democracy. From election to election and plebiscite to plebiscite, Venezuela is moving rapidly toward a "legal coup" that may be the logical consequence of the clashes inside Miraflores Palace.

 Promulgated in 12 August 1949, the Geneva POW Convention became effective on 21 October 1950. The United States is one of the signatories.

At a Japan-US summit meeting on 18 February, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi expressed some understanding of US President George W. Bush's remarks that Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK (North Korea) are an "axis of evil." This left the impression that Japan stands alone on this issue because European countries have been cool to Bush's "axis of evil" rhetoric. However, it will be difficult for Japan to provide support to the US, as it did when the US attacked Afghanistan, if US forces launch military action against Iraq. It can be said that the Japanese Government has put itself in a difficult position.

 Likewise, the more recent creation of Israel was accompanied, under the indifferent gaze of the Western and Soviet world, by the forced exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Today, these refugees and their descendants do not call into question the existence of the state of Israel as long as the injustice suffered is recognized and the implementation of their rights is negotiated fairly.

 In the past, whenever a coup occurred in some Latin American countries, there was always a backdrop of US involvement. The only guideline determining US rejection or support of the government of a [foreign] country is whether it follows US baton and whether its domestic and foreign policies are in accord with the US "national interests." On this matter, "supporting democracy" is but a signboard used by the United States. Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers. Only it was a little too early to get excited.

 Because the speech was about the State of the Union, President Bush seemed like he was underlining the "unilateral" role of the United States, thus dropping the coalition against terrorism. It is important to recall that the entire world that came out in protest against the September 11th attacks urged Washington to coordinate with its partners and allies.

 In its approach to the national Palestinian rights the Israeli Government is playing the cat and mouse game. It is trying to use the time factor to perpetuate the occupation. It is also working to push the Palestinians and the world into new labyrinths and tunnels, inside the old tunnels, to distract them from the main and central demands. The cycle of reoccupation-withdrawal-reoccupation is part of this approach, which is no secret to anyone.

 It would be entirely improper if, in its defense of Israel, the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries, such as, Syria and Lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the Hezbolah. It is worrying that among Powell's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front. In some circles, these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel-Palestine problem with a bigger one. For example, a new Israeli-Arab war.

 Contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of Sharon and Bush, this Zionist-US crime has confirmed that the Zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that "the Arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist" is now more distant than before despite some official Arab "recognitions." Millions of Arabs, Palestinians and non-Palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve "coexistence" with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity.

On 13 January, the leader of the Taiwanese authorities proudly announced at a gathering of pro-"Taiwan independence" elements that beginning this year Taiwanese travel documents would have an addition of "Taiwan" in English. He claimed that this was a "gift" to "Taiwan independence" groups. This is another dangerous signal of the leader of the Taiwanese authorities promoting "gradual Taiwan independence" and an attempt to split the motherland. We should maintain sharp vigilance on this move.

 Indeed, the U.S Administration, which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman, is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the United States itself. The ugliest crimes are perpetrated against inmates in U.S. prisons, and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by the U.S. police is so appalling that on several occasions it has led to massive riots. For instance, a bloody riot was ignited in Cincinnati when an Afro-American youth was shot dead for no reason by police officers.

 The announcement of a plan that is supposedly an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, but which in practice rejects it in a way that cannot be taken seriously by the countries who committed themselves to it (among which is Brazil), only deserves rejection in response and to provoke in retrospect an enormous concern about what the only world superpower intends in future.

 The first is that, once again, the current US administration, faced with a controversial issue, is situating itself alongside the explicit interests of companies in the energy sector. The long- standing ties Bush and several of his leading advisors have with these companies allow us to suppose an ultimate conflict of interests that would only increase with the government's persistent alignment with their goals. The Enron scandal is already taking a significant political toll of the Bush team, which will tend to increase. But the consequences of the divorce between the US and the international community in the Kyoto Protocol case could be even more serious.

 It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950, that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost. It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic, was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it. It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack.

 Most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers. Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom. These criminals know this fact, as much as we, the Arabs, do, because they are in direct contact with it.

 At the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change held recently in Morocco, Japan laid artificial obstacles to the session by seeking its own profit. In discussing the draft regulations to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force, Japan openly took issue with the draft regulations only because the contents of the regulations were not in its favor. It grudgingly agreed to it only when some countries made concessions and made amendments to the draft.

 Venezuela is the third largest exporter of oil within OPEC and the fourth as far as worldwide production is concerned. Venezuela is an important oil producing nation since its oil directly impacts crude prices in international markets. There is very little doubt that Chavez did not voluntarily resign his office and was in fact removed from power by the army. Evidently, during a phone conversation on Friday Chavez told his daughter that he was forced to resign and accept the army's non-negotiable conditions.

 It should be remembered that after Bush described the Kyoto Protocol as "fundamentally flawed" international negotiations on climate protection almost collapsed. The United States, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (25 percent of global emissions) withdrew from an international agreement that, for the first time, set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection. We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change. The European Union played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded, at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year, an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field. This must now be ratified by all the parties and will shortly enter into force. However, all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the United States takes measures that are comparable to these taken by Europe and Japan.

Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping.

 What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy. Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy. This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe. Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina. Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation.

 First off, Bush could have brought discipline to his administration in connection with the case of Argentina. Among US Government institutions, the State Department is the one most inclined to help Argentina, followed by the Security Council, albeit less enthusiastically. The Treasury Department, however, in spite of the good offices of its number two man, John Taylor, is still taking the cool approach towards Argentina that its head, Paul O'Neill, had adopted.

 Secondly, the designation of polling stations, as is now well known, was specifically done in a way that favoured ZANU PF by granting ridiculously few polling stations in urban areas.

 Even if, contrary to all reason, the operation turns out to be successful, the underlying problem would remain the same as before. Israel is responsible for about three million bitter people who lack political rights. The only means of preventing a return to terrorism would be [to launch] a counter-terrorist effort that extends to every village. This would soon erode both what is left of the army's reputation and its military cutting edge.

 Past weeks' Incidents, President Arafat's cease-fire declaration, the anti-violence campaign, the other activities that Israel brands terrorism, and Israel's unjustified escalation show that Palestinians are totally committed to the peace process and the previous agreements and understandings. This is because the Palestinians have the goal of peace in mind, while the Israeli Government does its utmost to hamper the peace process, entrench occupation, and step up settlement building. US envoy Zinni is supposed to have realized these clear-cut facts through his reading of the latest developments in the region.

 So, why do Rice and the US Administration launch campaigns against, and interfere in the affairs of, the Palestinian leadership? Rice is aware of the fact that President Yasir Arafat remained under siege in his headquarters in Ramallah for five months, imposed on him by the superior Israeli military in violation of all the accords that were signed by former Israeli governments and guaranteed by the United States.

 Therefore, China is justified in demanding that the United States, by creating conflicts and by embarking upon the policy of oppression and supremacy should stop interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights.

There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity.

 It is certain the Ben Eliezer's hallucination is a mere expression of failure to persuade the world to accept the brutality of the occupying forces' practices.

 The Israeli withdrawal was a correction of a mistake the Israeli Government made when it decided to reoccupy parts of the main West Bank cities following the assassination of Israeli minister Rehav'am Ze'evi. The reoccupation was a kind of collective punishment for the inhabitants of those cities and the villages around them, villages that constitute an organic and vital extension of the cities. The Israeli forces destroyed buildings and installations in those cities, arrested dozens of citizens, and killed dozens others. That showed that the ruling right-wing coalition in Israel is pursuing an occupational policy and is not, in the first place, willing to recognize the firm national Palestinian rights to freedom, independence, and the end of occupation and settlement.

 As is feared by the whole world, preservation of the environment is becoming an awfully grave and pressing problem that is linked to the existence of mankind. How the problems of the global warming and environmental preservation are handled today will have a major impact on the lives and health of people as well as the future development of the world. This is the reason why many people of the world today are demanding that the world take concrete measures for protecting the environment, as they have come to realize its importance. However, as was revealed this time, Japan, which was in a position to take the lead to solve the environmental problems, attempted to back away from solving the problems.

 Oil prices took a sharp downward trend after the quiet semi-coup d'etat by the American affiliated Venezuelan army generals who deposed the popularly elected president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Friday. The price of crude had taken a dramatic upsurge in the aftermath of the ever-deteriorating Middle East crisis, the unilateral cut off of Iraqi oil by Saddam Hussein and similar threats by several other oil producing countries. The dethroning of Chavez by the Americans is a message that disobeying Uncle Sam would have cataclysmic consequences.

 Emphasizing the significance of the adoption of the "Kyoto Protocol," Japan loudly trumpeted at that time that the adoption of the protocol was "produced by the role" Japan had played. Japan even called for working out practical measures to have it enter into force. Nonetheless, Japan, changing its stand this time, opposed the draft regulations to put the "Kyoto Protocol" into force and even called for liquidation of the draft. This shows how capricious Japan is and how frequently it changes its stand when the stakes matter the most. Of course, behind the Japan's behavior lies its stakes.

 Today, two forms of terrorism fuel each other. Palestinian terrorism, which existed on a very small scale in the time of Yitzhak Rabin, has taken on a dramatic dimension. But the Israeli response, with its "extra-judicial liquidations," is even more dramatic in a certain sense. It now resembles the destruction of the very people, so structured and organized is it. 
----
 This state of affairs provides suitable conditions to Israel to continue its occupation, colonialism, and building of settlements that have been imposed by military force on the Palestinian territories since 1967 to date. These Israeli aims are clear and do not need further clarification or explanation. Israel's impossible terms cannot be met by a nation that is determined to preserve its dignity and national unity. They are no more than frail excuses and pretexts to evade the peace process since this process does not agree with the ideology of expansion and the building of settlements. This ideology was explicitly embraced by the rightist blocs in the ruling Israeli coalition and is implicitly encouraged by Labor Party ministers in the current Israeli Government.

 The United States is currently run by a typical Texan mentality, which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples. This mentality simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment, because international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars.

 However, after a brief period of shock, Bush resumed his solitary road, as he clearly demonstrated in his State of the Union speech, in which he threatened the "Axis of Evil" countries (Iran, Iraq, and North Korea) without consulting the Europeans and Japanese, who do not necessarily agree with the appropriateness of antagonizing the governments of those nations.

 The clash between Israel and Palestine briefly appeared to be abating in the wake of the large-scale attack incident [taesupkyok sakon] against the United States. However, it has become fierce again after Israeli minister of tourism was assassinated. Taking advantage of this, Israel occupied six cities located in the Palestinian autonomous areas by the use of force.

 Since 11 September, the US has behaved as if it had a sort of natural right to create law. Because they had been the victims of terrorist attacks and, more deeply, because Americans are "good," even if, as President Bush had explained, the world did not always realize "how good they were." Until now, this right-this right right, if one prefers-has more or less been accepted by Washington's partners. The distress generated by one photograph published inadvertently or through excess self-confidence might only mean that this consensus is in the process of eroding. And that the Europeans, in particular, are no longer quite ready to follow the Americans in their way of thinking. 
----
 Despite all of this, however, US President Bush linked our country to terrorism by force and spewed out virulent remarks that our country is threatening the world's peace. What a brazen-faced deception of reality and unbearable insult to a sovereign state! What we cannot condone more than anything is that Bush arbitrarily designated our country as part of a so-called an axis of evil.

 When the Imam (may God be satisfied with him) issued the fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the holy Koran, the countries that are so-called supporters of human rights protested against the fatwa.

In a coordinated move the European countries all recalled their ambassadors from Tehran in order to put the Islamic Republic of Iran under pressure.
