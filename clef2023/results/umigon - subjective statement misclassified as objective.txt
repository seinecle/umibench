gold label was subjective not objective: 

This pain is the terror of government because it arrests its growth.
----
Mostly it is because Establishment conservatives and liberals are uniquely allied in their complacency and complaisance.
----
That the government are shoehorning what is left of their unpopular planning reforms into this Levelling Up legislation speaks to the vacuity of the ‘defining mission’.
----
We imagine today that everything is done by the aggregate without the will to act of any of the individuals composing the aggregate.
----
Public credit belongs to the people as a whole and they may do anything with it they like.
----
Anti-white hatred defines the Democratic coalition.
----
In part this is because the deleterious situation surrounding housing in the UK—a common feature of these columns—plays such a large, oversized role in economic and social life.
----
By limiting the focus of corporate boards to shareholders’ financial interests alone, corporate law intended to confine the sphere of influence of corporations as a means of protecting democracy and other civic institutions from corporate overreach—just as society confers certain legal advantages to non-profit corporations in return for confining their activities to the sphere of charitable causes.
----
Republicans attempted to pass a resolution that would have enabled Congress to force workers to accept a deal, which was fortunately blocked by (who else) Senator Bernie Sanders.
----
They do not want to redistribute wealth; they want only to prey upon it.
----
In fact, the rail carriers are profiting more than ever as they push their workers to the breaking point.
----
Stakeholder capitalism poisons democracy and partisan politics poisons capitalism.
----
But if “stakeholder capitalism is capitalism,” then why was it necessary to popularise the term in the first place?
----
But the party must do more than talk.
----
The everyday citizen in Western democracies ranging from America to Britain now correctly senses that something is amiss.
----
All the public treasuries will be rich.
----
This is also why the Left describes just about everyone touched by the nation’s immigration laws as an “immigrant” – whether they’re illegal aliens or legal permanent residents.
----
We may have faith that human inventiveness will prevail in the long run.
----
And wouldn't it be (secretly) reassuring if, as John Tanton likes to ask mordantly, the theorists of innovation had ever actually invented anything themselves?
----
As this logistics system becomes more interdependent and fragile, the potential leverage of these workers increases to a dramatic level.
----
But it’s more than clear that the original COVID shots aren’t stopping COVID, so why would this one work?
----
It must rise because government is the one thing that cannot be liquidated or deflated in time of economic depression.
----
Then we should all be working for government, either directly as state employees or indirectly to support the employees of the state.
----
The Immigration Invasion symbolizes a lot about the present state of the immigration debate.
----
There is yet everywhere a deficit in the public revenue because the shrinkage in everything taxable was so sudden and violent.
----
It also reveals the limits of their ideological position, why they can never really be counted on to address regional inequality.
----
In this zombie neoliberalism, there is only levelling up for the already rich.
----
In return for this extraordinary gift, corporate shareholders owed an implicit obligation back to society: namely, that corporations ought to consider not only shareholder interests but broader societal interests when making decisions.
----
The social fabric of a diverse democracy depends on preserving certain spaces as apolitical sanctuaries, especially in a divided body politic like ours.
----
The event, which organisers had envisaged as a celebration of a new, progressive era, turned into a chaotic nightmare.
----
This makes reading the reports indoctrinated policy wonks write difficult to read because when they write about “immigrants” it is unclear if they actually mean lawfully present immigrants or if they are using the word as a euphemism for illegal aliens.
----
"But the book does go wrong, of course, because it never thinks to question what a ""Hispanic"" is anyway."
----
A total ruin of the public credit would be a disaster in fact.
----
Leftists are also fond of invoking the magic of euphemism to make the social problems they create go away.
----
The likelihood of anything similar occurring in England presently seems slim.

The ruling class’s propaganda outlets just announced there is a brand new COVID variant moving around, just in time for autumn.
----
Reasonable minds can differ on this question, and this debate will take further book-length works to fully adjudicate.
----
By learning more about White privilege we can work to spend it.
----
It is imperative to reduce the cost of government by measure—that is, to make the tax dollar buy more than before.
----
If taxation meanwhile has to be heavily increased, so much the better, so long as the increase is, as it certainly will be, in the field of popular taxes, for thereby wealth is redistributed downward and capitalist society, in which they disbelieve, is on its way to trouble.
----
A government serious about equality and ‘levelling up’ would be looking to do the opposite of what this Bill does.
----
That is to say, corrupt government tends to limit and defeat itself.
----
That can happen again.
----
But taking refuge in public credit will cause that same infection to attack business, banking, industry, agriculture, the entire body of private enterprise.
----
Dr. Tanton's choice may seem astounding viewed from the perspective of Washington's ritualized Left-Right trench warfare.
----
It could increase spending or help bridge the financial gaps suffered by lower levels of government.
----
No particular kind of state is sacred, nor is any particular doctrine of wealth, but it is all the more dangerous to be going this road with no theory of either the kind of state it leads to or what shall be the status of private wealth within it.
----
And this wailing betrays the fatal tendency of non-economists: to view resources as absolutes and ignore the market's ingenuity in rationing by price and finding substitutes.
----
In principle, the central government could do more itself to revive growth.
----
However, getting annoyed at the language in which Bouvier and Grant's message is couched is not the same as establishing that it has no content at all.
----
First by habit one thinks of those for which we have traditional images: The machine, the boss, the pork barrel, the spoils system, the politician everywhere in his popular character, acquiring merit and power by spending public money; doing things for his people with the money of other people, taking care at the same time to do enough for himself with everybody’s money.
----
These predatory, parasitic, more or less shameless forces are inseparable from government.
----
Other countries pushed on a string.
----
There is another reason why the taxpayer himself is not entitled to that unctuous feeling in the presence of social service.
----
Or, are they actively trying to make sure they have a scapegoat for a drug-resistant form of the monkeypox?
----
It is not like China to settle for such underperformance.
----
If you’re looking for a bellwether for the world economy, you could do worse than consider what’s happening at the very highest end of London’s property market.
----
However, this demonstrates how Russia's media environment works.
----
This is actually a win for us because it exposes all the faults within our system and the reality of the people who are in power.
----
But the White House and mainstream media will try to avoid that kind of conversation.
----
This time around, the immigration issue has just snuck up and mugged the American nation, as opposed to the protracted debate before the last immigration cut-off in the 1920s.
----
As if the taxpayer were willing, for the sake of some immediate relief, to increase the load of those who come next.
----
They have not only tolerated but given encouragement to an ever-expanding cost of government.
----
Demands upon the public credit for social service are most difficult to resist.
----
DoDEA director Thomas Brady said: “Kelisa Wing is exactly the right person to lead our efforts in building on the foundational work done to support meaningful change in our organization.”  Yes, she is.
----
The Thought Police in the Biden-Harris regime ordered U.S. immigration enforcement agencies in April 2021 to refrain from using “alien” and “illegal alien.”
----
But what of American individualism?
----
But it needs to go much further.
----
A new variant that can evade vaccines and actually harm people will surface when the ruling class needs another lockdown to panic the unruly slaves into mass compliance out of fear.
----
The more efficient government is, the less it costs per measure, all the faster it may be extended without producing that very acute pain in the taxpayer’s pocket.
----
As for 'shock jocks' like Skabeyeva, their role is to bring the combative energy of Jerry Springer to George Orwell's ‘Two Minutes Hate.’
----
(It’s also true that Alien Nation was “a masterpiece of precision,” but that’s by the way.)
----
The government favors them naturally—”the most feathers for the least squawk.” And those radical forces, who may have nothing else in common with this government, favor them on the ground of doctrine.
----
Years of talk about missions, ‘left behind’ places, the ‘red wall’—all of this has been shown to be electoral hot air, always plainly nonsense but something the Tories and the press went along with anyway in order to pretend they actually had some sort of plan to end the stagnation for which they are responsible.
----
"But it will probably just claim that housewives (""homemakers"") are an oppressed minority deserving a federal program to protect their rights."
----
More recently, unexpected organising has taken place at high-profile companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Chipotle.
----
The explanation is simple.
----
Though the devil is in the detail—as campaigners from Living Rent have been vigilant in stressing—this represents a hugely positive development.
----
The tax power, in so many hands, is much less effective than it might be.
----
That the infamous 'Beast,' Biden's eight ton armoured presidential limousine, got stuck in traffic was gloatingly treated as poetic justice.
----
For intelligence, there is nothing like a keen-witted, handsome woman.
----
In addition, the ever-present threat of lockdowns has crushed the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs.
----
Which is a benefit of multicultural diversity that you will not read about in the New York Times—or on the Wall Street Journal editorial page for that matter.
----
Yet no environmentalist hoping to influence non-progressives can afford to ignore this economic point.
----
If it consolidates power into the hands of the government, we can expect the situation to be pushed hard.
----
Like the entire political class, and unlike the other authors under review, he seems serenely unaware that this is entirely the result of public policy—and undebated policy at that.
----
So, when is the next variant that will evade this vaccine too?
----
The cost of government by measure is one thing; the quantity of government, at any cost, is another.
----
There is very little in the way of investment or powers for the most deprived regions, no plan for investment in creaking infrastructure, nothing that would support new industries across the country.
----
Our system of unbridled profit-focused capitalism used to serve as perhaps the most important of those sanctuaries, but no longer.
----
The unanimous decision by the all-Democrat Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico, which came August 19 in the form of a new set of rules governing admission to the bar (pdf), is self-contradictory but it is clearer than most reports by leftist scribes.
----
Much of the book does indeed wail on about imminent economic and ecological collapse, complete with admiring quotations from Vice President Al Gore. (Anyone asked him about immigration?)
----
When the railroads throw themselves on the hands of the government and demand public credit to save them from bankruptcy, these radical forces do not protest, or, if they do, it is in an academic sense only; and the reason for this is that they believe in the public ownership of railroads, and see, perhaps more clearly than the others, that such use of public credit tends to bring the experiment of state ownership to pass.
----
Two and a half years into a disaster-ridden Parliament, however, ‘Levelling-Up’ remains a slogan-policy, beyond a small pot of money which seemed heavily skewed towards Tory and marginal constituencies.
----

Unravelling this Thatcherite model of housing—neither YIMBY fantasies nor ever-growing varieties of nominally ‘affordable’ housing are serious responses—is the prerequisite to meaningful change in this sphere of economic and social life.
----
Amid all this, having as it does such a decisive impact on the UK economy, time should be spent looking at the way the cost of living crisis interacts with, and is exacerbated by, the political economy of housing in the contemporary UK.
----
Given the combative willingness of rank-and-file rail workers to vote down contracts recently, it shouldn’t be simply assumed that workers will vote in favour of accepting the agreement.
----
So in just four or five years, Republican voters have awakened to reality [More than half of Republicans think minorities are favored over Whites in the United States, by Philip Bump, Washington Post, June 29, 2021].

It’s arguably the most damaging of them all: rampant and increasingly irresolvable cultural discord in democracies around the world.
----
The Conservative manifesto in 2019 was one of the least substantial in terms of what it proposed for a ruling party’s agenda, outside of its one major pledge to ‘Get Brexit Done’.
----
The Left wants to devalue and abolish citizenship and what it means to be American, and confer all the benefits of being legal on people who are illegal – and it is succeeding.
----
That state has sixty-two counties and sixty cities … In addition there are 932 towns, 507 villages, and, at the last count, 9,600 school districts … Just try to render efficient service … amid the diffused identities and inevitable jealousies of, roughly, 11,000 independent administrative officers or boards!

Population growth has its blind boosters, on whom it has not yet dawned that quality is infinitely more important that quantity.
----
"My favorite: Mr. Roberts's throw-away line that housework (""or homemaking, as it is now known"") is ""as demanding a job as any outside the home."""
----
Therefore, taxes must be increased, first in order to provide as much public revenue as before, and then further increased to provide more revenue than before.
----
Such a boss as this now commands the support, first, of all the beneficiaries of social service; secondly, of all who promote and live by social service; thirdly, of those whose doctrine is to take and give; and he has still his machine as it was before.
----
Yet Wing herself, so full of herself and certain of the righteousness of her own views, is the quintessential Karen.

Not less government, you see; the same amount of government for less money.

A careful reader of Who We Are can also trace the national demographic tipping resulting from immigration.

Now the oldest object of his animosity—namely, the political boss—has annexed the idea.

Not least in our immediate moment, as normal life is plunged into an extended period of national mourning.

And while local far-right activists appear to have quietly accepted defeat over Belgrade Pride, a tame and small-scale annual event, the ferocity of their opposition to EuroPride reveals that social attitudes are not much different from 2001.
----
They preach a gospel of the responsibility of the state to administer happiness, not because the state should, not because they themselves would prefer the kind of state that does, but simply that the state can.
----
Beyond all the double talk and cant, that’s what “diversity, equity, and inclusion” are all about.
----
Apparently, you’re simply expected to accept all this.
----
Here, existing government guidance, laughably, merely notes that rent increases must be ‘fair and realistic’.
----
Few journalists thought to ask why it is large parts of ‘left behind’ places needed ‘levelling up’ in the first place.
----
Local governments and their financing vehicles, which led the stimulus efforts in 2008, are not now so bold.
----
Any alternative would be revolutionary in principle, such as, for example, as for the state to appropriate all wealth and administer it directly.
----
But we are fighting the economic consequences of overliquidation and unjustified fear as to the future of the United States.
----
A key element in the fraud was crying racism.
----
The content of the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill proves that the only levelling up the ruling party is interested in is levelling up the bank accounts of the already rich.
----
Despite the title, its demographic section, while strong, is quite short—a surprise because Leon Bouvier has written several excellent detailed pamphlets on the impact of immigration on the population of key states.
----
[JF: I wrote in March 2020 that “A number of immigrant-borne diseases have struck American since then, and it's always considered racist to mention it.”

Whether this would be all for the best, or otherwise, is not yet the point.
----
The modern city is a new form of life, really, and one that we have no science for; in that form individual helplessness is a rising social liability.

Therefore these unprecedented uses of the public credit now being made, and proposed to be made, are to meet a crisis that must soon pass.

In China, by contrast, state-owned enterprises and local-government financing vehicles (which invest in infrastructure and other civic projects) borrowed eagerly from China’s banks at the government’s behest.

Most of the commitments the government has made seem to have started with a slogan, with the policy reverse engineered from there.

Consider, for example, what Olga Skabeyeva, one of the most energetically toxic, said on the government's Rossiya-1 channel.
----
It’s also true that mass immigration, which was out of control already in the 90s, is more out of control today, because the American governments of the last 25 years did nothing about it.
----
There’s currently no evidence of a direct question, but some serious scrutiny may be merited.
----
Partly this is because of deeply deceptive advertising for the 1965 Immigration Act, which ended the forty-year immigration lull and began effective discrimination in favor of Third World immigrants.

Modern Russia is a propaganda state, but not in the same way as the Soviet Union.

A brief interregnum—as the Conservative Party membership decided who should run the country—followed by a secondary interregnum—as matters monarchical are attended to—may well precipitate a fallacious sense that all is well and rosy in Albion.

"Here Mr. Roberts's reproduction of the conventional wisdom is useful, if unsettling: ""The sheer volume of newcomers,"" he says, ""may demand that if assimilation remains a goal [emphasis added] it will require more give and less take by the nation's non-immigrants than has been customary."""

And so these ideas spread like wildfire from community to community.

The cost of living crisis is exacerbated by our long-running, ever-worsening cost of renting crisis—but this has not arisen newly in the way the energy crisis relatively has.

Chinese crime, like Chinese cuisine, varies according to regional origin.

Once her rancid Twitter feed started to get media attention, Wing protected her tweets, but the cat was already out of the bag.

Stakeholder capitalism is part of a broader worldview that holds that corporate leaders should play a fundamental role in determining and implementing a society’s core values.
----
"For example, Chinese immigrants no doubt deserve the ""model minority"" title pressed on them by the media and vote-hungry Republican politicians, at least in contrast to other recent arrivals."
----
Usually, when politicians use these open, Newspeak-type terms, it is because they are trying to obscure more than they want to say.
----
This panicked response from political elites and media institutions was not completely unfounded; a rail strike would indeed have caused a crisis in our supply chain and the general economy.
----
In other words, those who are breaking U.S. law by their presence in the country, will now be allowed to practice law in the Land of Enchantment.
----
This is what the world’s most influential proponent of stakeholder capitalism, BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink, meant when he proclaimed that “companies need to earn their social license to operate every day.” This is a respectable view.
----
Of course not.
----
But the risk is real.
----
It seems like there are gearing up for several different angles.
----
That could be more efficient, if companies know better than the government how to spend the money.
----
Despite all the talk of a postindustrial and service economy, there is no getting around the fact that our economy still cannot function without industrial labour.
----
The basis of this paradoxical inclination is the lack of personal will, and this lack of personal will itself comes from the horror of responsibility
----
In this sense, listening to the wails of Mr. Bouvier and Mr. Grant may be a sort of spiritual and intellectual discipline.
----
Republicans can hope for big victories if they oppose anti-white racism in the classroom and in public policy.
----
She doesn’t seem ever to have demonstrated a level of self-awareness that would have enabled her to realize that.
----
It is superficial wherein it aims only to abate a very acute pain in the taxpayer’s pocket, and if anyone supposes that reducing the cost of government by economy and greater efficiency will limit government itself, it is elusive at the crucial point.
----
And guess what?
----
Plenty of people are keen to diss the UK at the moment, but the factors that make Britain a safe place to live and work remain steady – we are on the Greenwich meridian so can trade east and west; we are politically stable; we are an island; and we have a strong rule of law.
----
The senator was only human.
----
In its initial draft, though, the Bill contains very little that can be said to ‘Level Up’, in the sense of action and investment that would significantly alter the lives of people across the UK—those whose towns, cities, and infrastructure have lacked the investment of London and parts of the South East for decades.
----
Anyone sticking their head above the parapet and claiming they know where the world will be in 12-36 months is sticking their finger in the air.
----
And it follows by necessity that certain functions of government are assumed, as, for example, the wisdom to know when a crisis is such a crisis, to know when liquidation has gone far enough, when prices are too low, when they are high enough again, how many bank failures constitute a crisis in banking, how many railroad failures constitute a crisis in railroad credit, and so on.
----
Nonetheless I believe it falls short for legal and historical reasons that I lay out in “Woke, Inc”, my book published last year.

In the US, freight railroad workers have been pushed to breaking point while the rail carriers profit more than ever – and while a strike was averted in the early hours of Thursday morning, it isn't off the table.

In all of these ways we are exchanging freedom for something else—for security, for status, for refuge from the terrors of individual responsibility.
----
But if immigration is stopped—even as late as the year 2000, by which time another 10 to 15 million immigrants will have arrived—Americans seem likely to stabilize their numbers voluntarily in the 300-million range.
----
And remember that the pandemic isn’t over.

The single issue that overcame all others: Mr. Buchanan's criticism of immigration.

And now you will see a selective struggle taking place within government itself.

The one least considered is what may be called the biological aspect, in which government is like an organism with such an instinct for growth and self-expression that if let alone it is bound to destroy human freedom—not that it might wish to do so but that it could not in nature do less.
----
Observe that in time of prosperity government is bound to extend itself because revenues are plenty and there is always a purblind demand for special benefits to be conferred by public credit.
----
The pandemic and politics are two primary factors.

News media repeated the slogan, inquired sincerely as to what it might mean, asked when it might happen, projected their own visions on to it.

What the Levelling Up Bill is really is a Planning Bill in disguise, something the Committee made clear at the very beginning of their evidence sessions.
----
But when one expresses a timid doubt regarding the necessity for such and such a project because of the expense, these boosters argue, “The public demands it,” when, as a matter of fact, they themselves originated the scheme… Further tax-boosting influences emanate from the “per capita” or “model” standards.
----
Not less government; only as much government as before for less money.

Certainly if the structure of government were rationalized, we could easily have as much government as before for less money.

Regardless of whether this tentative agreement is approved or not, deep issues with the rail system will remain.

Despite a mass media campaign to make you believe getting a booster is essential to “top up your immunity” due to declining effectiveness, it is actually impossible for vaccine effectiveness to wane when it comes to the Covid-19 injections.

As is often the case, when assessing political economic phenomena affecting and afflicting the UK, particularly in the sphere of housing, one doesn’t have to venture too far to find alternative approaches.

Now suppose that under stress of abnormal public revenue the structure of government is somewhat rationalized and that by such means as economy and efficiency the cost of government by measure is much reduced.

Part of what it means to live in a democracy is for those questions to be determined by the citizenry—publicly through debate and privately at the ballot box—where each person’s view is unadjusted according to the number of dollars that he controls in the marketplace.

Although left-wingers are fond of saying conservatives speak in code –former Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) famously said tax cuts were racist dog whistles (“It’s not ‘spic’ or ‘n*****’ anymore. They say, ‘Let’s cut taxes”)– leftists really do speak in code.
