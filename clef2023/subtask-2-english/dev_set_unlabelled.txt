(It’s also true that Alien Nation was “a masterpiece of precision,” but that’s by the way.)
It’s all justified in the name of racial “equity.” But it’s nothing more than a nice way of saying they want to destroy the Historic American Nation.
These issues include punishing Sanctuary Cities and increasing deportations.
Only 20 percent of voters support it, while a third aren’t quite sure what it is [Poll: Nearly Half of Registered Voters Oppose Teaching of Critical Race Theory, by Susan Berry, Breitbart, November 16, 2021].
In contrast, in 2017 fewer than half of Republicans said minorities are favored over whites.
In part this is because the deleterious situation surrounding housing in the UK—a common feature of these columns—plays such a large, oversized role in economic and social life.
The Immigration Invasion symbolizes a lot about the present state of the immigration debate.
For half a century, household expenditure on gas and electricity has, in real terms, hovered around the £1,000 mark.
This always reminds me of something I read in Patrick O’Brian’s book Desolation Island, set at the time of the War of 1812, where the British spymaster compares an American woman spy to Aphra Behn, who had lived several generations before.
But the party must do more than talk.
The GOP is reluctantly embracing White Identity politics—because it wins elections.
He died in 2019.
Not least in our immediate moment, as normal life is plunged into an extended period of national mourning.
According to Gelbaum himself: "I did tell [Sierra Club Executive Director] Carl Pope in 1994 or 1995 that if they ever came out anti-immigration, they would never get a dollar from me" [The Man Behind the Land by Kenneth R. Weiss, LA Times, October 17, 2004].
Of course, what we’re still living with is a disease “brought here by immigration”—and we’re still being called racist for saying so.]
In June 2020, Wing wrote: “I’m exhausted with these white folx in these [professional development] sessions.” Wing was misusing the Left’s insane lexicon here, for “folx,” as Merriam-Webster, which is now as woke as everyone else, tells us is a spelling that is “used especially to explicitly signal the inclusion of groups commonly marginalized.”
Despite the title, its demographic section, while strong, is quite short—a surprise because Leon Bouvier has written several excellent detailed pamphlets on the impact of immigration on the population of key states.
A November poll found that nearly half of American voters want the CRT anti-white curricula banned.
But in a broader sense, even were we absent this phenomenon entirely, the ongoing crisis of housing afflicting the UK should be seen in a similar light.
However, getting annoyed at the language in which Bouvier and Grant's message is couched is not the same as establishing that it has no content at all.
Nevertheless, they have also brought with them massive organized crime, rooted in history and fertilized by heroin.
Apparently, you’re simply expected to accept all this.
As has been pointed out elsewhere, the cost of rent is considerably greater than even the spiralling cost of energy bills.
But the book does go wrong, of course, because it never thinks to question what a "Hispanic" is anyway.
Wing likes that “Karen” moniker, which became popular in the early COVID-19 days referring to a certain type of self-righteous busybody.
The constituent parts—a lack of tenant protections, absence of rent controls, a dismantling of social housing provision—predate this current crisis and are not accidents of history but foundational pieces in the deliberate building of a housing regime conducive to maximum rent extraction.
In Denmark, the government, alongside supporting parties, has announced a cap on rent increases in the private rented sector of 4% over the coming two years.
Campaigning against anti-white discrimination is a good sign.
About as dull and conventional as you would expect, this is a more or less digestible mass of Census data washed down with drafts of pious hogwash.
Dr. Tanton came out of the environmental movement—there's a lot of environment around his home in Petoskey, up at the northern end of Michigan's Lower Peninsula.
[W]ill you really feel good at the end of the race when you look back and see others fighting obstacles that you didn’t even have?”
Wing is also the co-author of several Leftist indoctrination books for children, including one entitled What Is White Privilege?
But Biden’s FDA recommended it, and according to Politico above, Biden’s CDC head Rochelle Walensky defended it.
Funny thing: the MSM is at least partly right.
("Between April 1, 1985, and December 31, 1992, the number of foreign-born inmates in New York [jails] rose 194 per cent." Hmmm. Original base? Proportion of total? State, city, or federal jails?)
Instead, it is distracted by fantasies of racial discrimination and victimhood propaganda.
But of course, that didn’t mean 300 million Americans—immigrants account for about 13.7% of the US population, and about a quarter of those are illegal (Key findings about U.S. immigrants, Pew Research Foundation, August 26, 2020).]
They shriek over attempts to ban Critical Race Theory.
Here, existing government guidance, laughably, merely notes that rent increases must be ‘fair and realistic’.
It might be laughable if it wasn't pushing hundreds of thousands into debt and poverty.
And they really don’t like complaints about President Biden’s crass promise that his first nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court must be a black woman, especially embarrassing because Affirmative Action is now on SCOTUS’ docket.
On current projections, absent government action, it would have been rapidly heading towards £6,000.
The most recent figures point to close to 500,000 households falling behind on rent, the highest numbers in over a decade.
Unravelling this Thatcherite model of housing—neither YIMBY fantasies nor ever-growing varieties of nominally ‘affordable’ housing are serious responses—is the prerequisite to meaningful change in this sphere of economic and social life.
But it is absurd to claim that housework is as difficult and dangerous as fighting a fire or walking a beat, unless things are ordered very differently in the Roberts household.
Thus it may be untrue that some super AIDS virus is even now incubating in the vast human Petri dishes that the Third World's sprawling cities constitute, and will be brought here by immigration.
Assuming, that is, that environmentalists want to influence non-progressives.
But here's what it looks like in practice.
[JF: Which emphatically turned out not to be the case.
They must adopt and champion an immigration moratorium, an end to birthright citizenship, and more forcefully, challenge the erasure of American heritage.
That’s because the Sierra Club was bribed by a globalist billionaire named David Gelbaum who gave $100 million dollars to the organization, and used that leverage to stop them backing patriotic and ecologically beneficial immigration policies.
All of this amid falling pay: the most recent labour market statistics show the average weekly wage is £25 less this year than it was last year, while staggeringly, real weekly wages are still below the levels of 2008.
A careful reader of Who We Are can also trace the national demographic tipping resulting from immigration.
At a rally in January, Trump said that whites face discrimination that puts them in the back of the line.
A brief interregnum—as the Conservative Party membership decided who should run the country—followed by a secondary interregnum—as matters monarchical are attended to—may well precipitate a fallacious sense that all is well and rosy in Albion.
Americans at the grassroots are organizing in opposition to immigration, around and increasingly across traditional political battle lines.
The last line of this NR piece was “Mr. Brimelow's book Alien Nation: Common Sense about America's Immigration Disaster will be published by Random House in February.”
Chinese crime, like Chinese cuisine, varies according to regional origin.
Of course, trying to corral a recalcitrant two-year-old at bedtime is certainly harrowing.
Ohio Senate candidate J.D.
It's hard for this book to go completely wrong, given the rich data provided by the Census.
Donald Trump, says Wing, is the “whole [almost certainly autocorrect for white] boy version of a Karen” and former education secretary Betsy DeVos as “the queen of Karens.”
“If another Karen tells me about her feelings,” she exclaimed in one tweet, “I might lose it.”
This is well-known, and when not denying, the MSM either justifies it or encourages it—see a partial list of our coverage below:  The third bemoans Trump’s attack on progressive prosecutors—many of whom are black—who spend more time on his business dealings than on crime.
As an excellent recent Tribune column from Florence Wildblood shows, tenants are finding themselves caught between a rock and a hard place: ‘either trying to find somewhere to live, competing with dozens of interested parties, or clinging on to what they have, swallowing hefty rent increases and putting up with substandard living conditions’.
It’s also true that mass immigration, which was out of control already in the 90s, is more out of control today, because the American governments of the last 25 years did nothing about it.
At least a dozen GOP-controlled state legislatures are aiming to ban CRT in schools.
But it will probably just claim that housewives ("homemakers") are an oppressed minority deserving a federal program to protect their rights.
But it needs to go much further.
For example, Chinese immigrants no doubt deserve the "model minority" title pressed on them by the media and vote-hungry Republican politicians, at least in contrast to other recent arrivals.
Portugal has announced rent caps—landlords can increase rent by only 2% in the coming year.
It “directs…education programs for school-age children of Department of Defense personnel” and “provides support and resources to Local Educational Agencies throughout the United States that serve children of military families.”
The mission of the Defense Department is to defend the United States from military threats.
It may or may not be true that Mrs. Behn warned the British government, but it is certainly true that De Ruyter came and burned a lot of ships in the Medway in 1667.
Which means that How Many Americans?, like Lutton and Tanton's book, has a significance beyond its content.
They wring their hands about Republican candidates and lawmakers who mention anti-white racism.
Anti-white hatred defines the Democratic coalition.
They fret that Republicans are—gasp—embracing White Identity Politics.
The anti-CRT messaging turned them out in record numbers.
It must explicitly act for the benefit of white Americans.
[JF: Roberts updated this in 2004 with Who We Are Now—The Changing Face Of America In The 21st Century, and chapter 11 was titled “Our Changing Complexion.” Sample quote: “No single group changed the face of America more in the 1990s than immigrants.
Several states have already done so, to the acclaim of voters [GOP sees ‘huge red wave’ potential by targeting critical race theory, by Liz Crampton, Politico, January 5, 2022].
Especially after the famous victory that Julian Simon, the celebrated economist and immigration enthusiast, scored over Paul Ehrlich, the equally celebrated scientist and ecological doomster, by winning a bet that the prices of allegedly scarce commodities would fall over the next decade.
A quick survey of the terrain regarding housing shows the seriousness of the situation.
On nearly every issue dealing with immigration, voters were more likely to vote for Vance knowing that he is an immigration patriot.
It’s the smart and natural thing to do.
A strong majority of Trump voters also believe that non-whites are favored over whites.
Which is a benefit of multicultural diversity that you will not read about in the New York Times—or on the Wall Street Journal editorial page for that matter.
Population growth puts far and away the greatest pressure on the environment, particularly from the perspective of those, like Dr. Tanton, who value wilderness for its own sake, as an amenity, rather than wailing on about imminent economic or ecological collapse.
A sample of what the Lügenpresse thinks is a fire bell in the night:  The first two articles attacked Republicans for bringing attention to the various states that prioritize non-whites for virus treatment.
He is simultaneously a practicing eye surgeon and a formidable political entrepreneur who helped organize both the Federation for Immigration Reform and U.S. English (and more recently English Language Advocates, its harder-line rival).
And in the U.S., population growth is increasingly driven by immigrants and their descendants.
They publish Dem Talking Point “fact checks” about truthful claims that Democrat states discriminate against whites in distributing treatment for the China Virus.
Scotland, too, has now joined the ranks of nations intervening in the private rented sector, announcing a rent freeze and moratorium on evictions, due to run through March 2023.
The blurb describes it as an "unflinching, progressive voice," and it is.
In another tweet, Wing complained that “this lady actually had the CAUdacity to say that black people can be racist too…I had to stop the session and give Karen the BUSINESS…we are not the majority, we don’t have power.”
It is true that we did nothing about it, and that the ships were burnt; but the report itself was a masterpiece of precision. Yes, yes.’”
Like the entire political class, and unlike the other authors under review, he seems serenely unaware that this is entirely the result of public policy—and undebated policy at that.
DoDEA director Thomas Brady said: “Kelisa Wing is exactly the right person to lead our efforts in building on the foundational work done to support meaningful change in our organization.”  Yes, she is.
Wing frequently expressed exasperation with how insolently white people dared to behave in her presence.
A remarkable 200,000 copies of this book are reportedly already in circulation, thanks to various anti-immigration groups.
With over half of social housing residents relying on credit or buy-now, pay-later services to cover their monthly essential needs, such an increase will no doubt bring greater hardship to a group whose incomes are already 40% below that of the median.
All of this reflects the political economy of housing—the political economy of renting, and of rentiers—that so shapes the contemporary UK economy: particularly so in England.
Earlier: Ariz. GOP Senate Candidate Blake Masters Appears To Be Running As An Immigration Patriot
We may have faith that human inventiveness will prevail in the long run.
Much of the book does indeed wail on about imminent economic and ecological collapse, complete with admiring quotations from Vice President Al Gore. (Anyone asked him about immigration?)
Those over 65 now own almost 50% of housing wealth; rents, as I discussed in a previous column, hover around 40% of income.
And during no other decade in the nation's history have foreigners so profoundly altered the country's complexion in so many ways.” The 2004 book also contains a favorable reference to the “browning” of America, which is totally not a racist thing to say if you’re in favor of it.]
Mostly it is because Establishment conservatives and liberals are uniquely allied in their complacency and complaisance.
Amidst this backdrop the house price unaffordability bonanza continues: as Ed Conway of Sky News recently noted, where the average individual was paid £32,000 over the last year, the average house increased in value by £39,000.
Here Mr. Roberts's reproduction of the conventional wisdom is useful, if unsettling: "The sheer volume of newcomers," he says, "may demand that if assimilation remains a goal [emphasis added] it will require more give and less take by the nation's non-immigrants than has been customary."
The single issue that overcame all others: Mr. Buchanan's criticism of immigration.
By learning more about White privilege we can work to spend it.
Once her rancid Twitter feed started to get media attention, Wing protected her tweets, but the cat was already out of the bag.
No similar edification can be derived from Who We Are: A Portrait of America Based on the Latest U.S. Census, by Sam Roberts, an urban-affairs reporter at the New York Times.
As is often the case, when assessing political economic phenomena affecting and afflicting the UK, particularly in the sphere of housing, one doesn’t have to venture too far to find alternative approaches.
Cucky pundits claimed non-whites made Youngkin governor, but the Republican candidate received unprecedented support from rural whites.
My favorite: Mr. Roberts's throw-away line that housework ("or homemaking, as it is now known") is "as demanding a job as any outside the home."
The likelihood of anything similar occurring in England presently seems slim.
Yet this strange anti-nation seems fated, if immigration continues, to be by early next decade the largest minority in the United States.
Even a Liz ‘no to handouts, yes to tax cuts’ Truss ministry, whether willingly or otherwise, has been forced to cover a serious chunk of this difference.
Now that the baffling, elongated, hyperreal coronation has occurred—no, not that one—and Liz Truss has become Prime Minister, a degree of intervention and action on energy bills has emerged, ahead of the looming socioeconomic catastrophe facing the country this winter.
Though the devil is in the detail—as campaigners from Living Rent have been vigilant in stressing—this represents a hugely positive development.
The fourth focused on Republican criticism of Biden’s excluding whites from the pool of candidates to replace Justice Stephen Breyer.
While other countries bring in rent freezes and caps to help people face winter, guidance in England just says rent hikes should be 'fair and realistic'.
Privilege is like extra money in your pocket that you didn’t earn.”
Amid all this, having as it does such a decisive impact on the UK economy, time should be spent looking at the way the cost of living crisis interacts with, and is exacerbated by, the political economy of housing in the contemporary UK.
For intelligence, there is nothing like a keen-witted, handsome woman.
The book doesn’t just cast white folks (not folx, remember) into the outer darkness where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Republicans can hope for big victories if they oppose anti-white racism in the classroom and in public policy.
But in fact it was intensely rational.
The “Sailer Strategy,” named for VDARE.com’s great Steve Sailer, is a proven political winner.
Partly this is because of deeply deceptive advertising for the 1965 Immigration Act, which ended the forty-year immigration lull and began effective discrimination in favor of Third World immigrants.
A lot of subsequent unpleasantness could have been avoided if people had listened—or if Republicans had listened to their constituents—see Ed Rubenstein’s How A 1992 Moratorium Could Have Helped Preserve the Historic American Majority.
Some on the Right spin Trumpism as Moynihanian ends by Buchananite means.
If you are White you might feel bad about hurting others or you might feel afraid to lose this privilege….Overcoming White privilege is a job that must start with the White community….
We would have been happy to buy them.]
The fight, however, continues.
Beyond all the double talk and cant, that’s what “diversity, equity, and inclusion” are all about.
[JF: Originally this said “(Copies of the latter are available from the former)” with the phone number of US INC. Tanton’s organization.
Logically, however, environmentalists cannot be among them.
So Americans can now savor Cantonese (vice and extortion), Taiwanese (fraud, money laundering), and Fukienese (violence).
[JF: They were declared the largest minority on January 22, 2003, by the U.S. Census.]
“If you're a white guy, tough luck,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said of Biden’s message on his Supreme Court pick.
The Leftist Mainstream Media is worried about a GOP/GAP wave this election cycle.
“I had some of her Antwerp reports in my hands not a week since, when we were looking through the Privy Council files, and they were brilliant, Maturin, brilliant.
They want white kids to learn to hate themselves, to put whites at the back of the line for health treatment, to discriminate against them in employment, and to open the borders to replace them.
Here's a larger version of that chart above:  Eight-four percent of Trump voters say discrimination against whites is real and will greatly increase.
But it is not a logical impossibility.
Peter Brimelow remembers him here: “A Citizen Who Took Up Arms For His Country,” December 26, 2019.]
The publication by the Sierra Club of this explicit account of the inexorable relationship between immigration, population growth, and environmental stress certainly suggests that the other hiking boot is about to drop, and that this most powerful of liberal lobbies is about to act on the immigration issue. At last.
In this capacity, he is editor and publisher of The Social Contract, the definitely unfrantic scholarly quarterly magazine that sponsored the book.
Republicans are prioritizing Critical Race Theory as one of their prime midterm issues, and some have had the courage to say it’s nothing more than anti-white racism [Blake Masters: You Have To Be Able To Say “Critical Race Theory Is Anti-White Racism,” by Tim Hains, RealClearPolitics, January 23, 2022].
John Tanton himself exemplifies both the ferment and the fluidity Out There, beyond the Beltway.
When a critic took issue with Wing’s claim that “racism is ingrained in the very fabric of our country,” the diversity, equity, and inclusion chief’s response was succinct: “Bye Karen.”
Population growth has its blind boosters, on whom it has not yet dawned that quality is infinitely more important that quantity.
What all this indicates is how far from such a model of renting, still relatively widespread across much of Europe, the English private rented sector has moved.
[JF: Well, this, combined with Peter’s 1992 National Review cover story Time To Rethink Immigration, and the book Alien Nation, which was at this this time just about to come out, represents the start of the (repressed) immigration debate of the 90s.
Leon F. Bouvier and Lindsey Grant project that the U.S. population will rise to 396 million by 2050 and 492 million by 2100—that is, nearly double today's total of 250 million.
And against this backdrop, and with swathes of the media seeming more apoplectic about the comedian Joe Lycett puncturing the cosy consensus than the government consciously sleepwalking through a crisis so as to benefit from action upon Truss’ accession, there is a danger that Truss’ interventions will be treated as the be-all and end-all in terms of the cost of living crisis.
The surveys show it.
There are indeed cases of societies that have destroyed themselves by triggering ecological catastrophe—notably the Mayans, who exhausted their jungle soil.
[JF: I wrote in March 2020 that “A number of immigrant-borne diseases have struck American since then, and it's always considered racist to mention it.”
Stephen Maturin, a key character, had only heard of Behn as a playwright, but the spymaster corrects him.
The fact that the highly professional environmental lobby in Washington has been so silent as immigration has soared is a measure of the extent to which it has been seduced by its liberal allies.
Yet Wing herself, so full of herself and certain of the righteousness of her own views, is the quintessential Karen.
Wing, who calls herself a “woke administrator,” demonstrated that she would be a perfect person to serve as a diversity, equity, and inclusion officer when she took to Twitter and unleashed her hatred against white people.
So in just four or five years, Republican voters have awakened to reality [More than half of Republicans think minorities are favored over Whites in the United States, by Philip Bump, Washington Post, June 29, 2021].
What could possibly go wrong?
But, alas, The Social Contract Magazine is no longer published and while its archives are still online, all the physical copies of back issues were destroyed by the new management at US INC, including issues that we more or less wrote ourselves (Spring 2008—A VDARE Reader and Winter 2006-2007 “Mass immigration and the 'National Question'”).
[JF: Obviously, immigration wasn’t stopped: the current population of the United States is 329.5 million—it passed 300 million in 2006.
This Census category was created by political pressure and reflects neither race, nor culture, nor even language, since many Hispanics can't speak Spanish.
pic.twitter.com/ebaKIycQW5— Joshua Tait (@Joshua_A_Tait) February 7, 2022  While the Leftist MSM mock the idea of anti-white discrimination, the vast majority of Republicans surveyed believe it’s a real problem.
Yet he reports that in the 1992 presidential primary he voted for Patrick J. Buchanan.
When Wing got her diversity, equity, and inclusion job at the Department of Defense in December 2021, the Department proudly said that she “has been involved with diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts for students and schools over many years, authoring several books on the topic.”
There are indeed cases of societies that have suffered disastrous die-offs because population growth outstripped their technical and institutional capacities—notably Ireland during the potato famine.
Now, this angry, self-righteous racist oversees diversity, equity, and inclusion for the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), which, according to a Tuesday Fox News report, “provides K-12 education to the DoD community in the U.S. and all over the world.”
It is frankly a handbook, almost a work in progress in its frantic pack-rat compilation of press clippings, the assimilation and accuracy of which left me sometimes uneasy.
She told us that De Ruyter was coming to burn our ships.
Only 38 percent of Trump voters care about the much-hyped discrimination claims of non-whites [84 percent of Trump voters are worried about discrimination against whites, by Maureen Breslin, The Hill, October 8, 2021].
It says reassuringly: “There is hope!
But what about the short run?
To paraphrase her hero—in a manner which even the Laffer Curve-loving subsections of her party would in private admit—at this juncture, there really was no alternative.
That can happen again.
The MSM is right to fear that white identity politics will play well for Republicans.
If the New York Times intends to reverse a generation of brainwashing women to despise their traditional roles, that would be nice.
This time around, the immigration issue has just snuck up and mugged the American nation, as opposed to the protracted debate before the last immigration cut-off in the 1920s.
Demand creates supply, however, and you can now read about this and many other delights in Wayne Lutton and John Tanton's The Immigration Invasion, a treasure trove of facts on the most critical but worst-covered issue in American politics.
Where Denmark, Portugal, and France respectively are capping private rent increases at 4, 2, and 3.5%, the UK government thus far has only commented on increases in the social rented sector—and here, they are proposing a 5% increase as their preferred solution.
Anti-white identity politics is the glue that holds together the Democrat Party’s fringe coalition.
She is exactly the right person to do what diversity, equity, and inclusion departments everywhere are designed to do: sow resentment and division and hamstring the actual efforts of the organization foolish enough to establish one.
It’s full of what you would expect: “White privilege hurts a lot of people.
And in France, too, government action is limiting the ability of landlords to raise rents—in this case, capping any increases to 3.5%.
In 2016, American voters elected a President who ran on a platform of patriotic immigration reform.
And wouldn't it be (secretly) reassuring if, as John Tanton likes to ask mordantly, the theorists of innovation had ever actually invented anything themselves?
But the MSM does have a point about GOP rhetoric finally targeting anti-white racism.
Vance’s pollster found that the issues that most animate GOP primary voters deal with race and culture [J.D. Vance pollster issues warning on Ohio Senate race, by Alex Isenstadt, Politico, February 7, 2022].
The plain fact is that the GOP base wants white identity politics.
If you’re a patriotic American, black, white, or whatever, who believes in the equality of dignity and rights of all people, regardless of race, Kelisa Wing, the Department of Defense’s chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer, hates you.
For example, by reading carefully you can pick up enough signs of social pathology among Hispanics to refute the hopeful neoconservative contention that their "family values" are worth importing.
The GOP must do much more to show it’s the party of white Americans aka the party of the Historic American Nation.
To put this into perspective, this is almost 100,000 households more than fell into arrears during the first year of the pandemic.
“CAUdacity” is “Caucasian audacity,” and you can see how marginalized poor Wing really is: she had to stop the session and lecture this uppity white woman about how powerless black folx such as Wing herself actually are. Indeed.
Anti-CRT rhetoric won the Virginia gubernatorial race for Glenn Youngkin.
He had links with Planned Parenthood and with the campaign to legalize abortion in Michigan (before the Supreme Court deprived Americans of the right to decide the question, a development of which he creditably disapproves).
Yet no environmentalist hoping to influence non-progressives can afford to ignore this economic point.
[JF: Dr. John Tanton was, of course, the great American immigration patriot who can be credited (or blamed and demonized by the Treason Lobby) for founding the modern immigration control movement.
In this sense, listening to the wails of Mr. Bouvier and Mr. Grant may be a sort of spiritual and intellectual discipline.
And this wailing betrays the fatal tendency of non-economists: to view resources as absolutes and ignore the market's ingenuity in rationing by price and finding substitutes.
Thus, while the word "illegitimacy" is now apparently banned, nearly 30 per cent of Hispanic households are headed by a single parent, compared to less than 19 per cent among whites. (The black rate tops 58 per cent.)
A 2020 think tank study of Trump voters found that they were primarily defined by their opposition to immigration and political correctness and their affinity for white identity [The National Populist Illusion: Why Culture, Not Economics, Drives American Politics, by George Hawley and Richard Hanania, CSPI, November 30, 2020].
But if immigration is stopped—even as late as the year 2000, by which time another 10 to 15 million immigrants will have arrived—Americans seem likely to stabilize their numbers voluntarily in the 300-million range.
Yes, the feted rise in energy bills—now partially offset by belated, albeit welcome, government intervention—would have represented a cataclysmic economic shock.
But in the kingdom of the blind, or deliberately unseeing, the one-eyed pack rat is king—or at any rate can keep his snout pointed in the right direction.
The cost of living crisis is exacerbated by our long-running, ever-worsening cost of renting crisis—but this has not arisen newly in the way the energy crisis relatively has.
She doesn’t seem ever to have demonstrated a level of self-awareness that would have enabled her to realize that.
So the exhausting white people in Wing’s meetings couldn’t have been “folx,” but Wing has more than enough racist anti-white tweets to maintain her woke bona fides.
Dr. Tanton's choice may seem astounding viewed from the perspective of Washington's ritualized Left-Right trench warfare.
In every sector of policy—education, immigration, health care, even foreign affairs—Democrats emphasize that their policies will shaft whitey in favor of the great POC coalition.
