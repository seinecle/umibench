Would it kill @apple to put a braille type bump on their earbuds so we know which bud is R and L in the dark.

Dear @apple My new Air is now a notbook since your update killed #wifi #bug #destroying #productivity

I'm suspecting @Apple timed the health-decline of my iPhone 4 perfectly with the iPhone 4s release... My battery is seriously ailing.

@twitter can you look at problem on iPad where it won't open @ messages. It just crashes the app. You too @apple maybe your fault.

After a week or so with @Apple's #iOS5 I'm considering going back to #jailbroken 4.2 - same features as 5, plus more. Not as stable, though.
